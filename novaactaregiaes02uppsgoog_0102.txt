to 4—3- years, (i. e. from an arc of about 27 ⁰) should be so perfect as to
represent with strict accuracy the motion of the planet for any very long·
time. Since the publication of M:r Alle's work the planet has nearly com-
pleted two revolutione, and accordingly it will soon be time to ascertain, by
the comparison of calculation with observation, what corrections it is neces-
sary to apply to the received elements in order that theory may faithfully
represent this heavenly body's actual motion, and it is with the view of
facilitating this work that the following provisional theory has been cal-
culated.

There is one circumstance however which must not here be passed
over in total silence, since it is possible that it may cause all theory re-
specting the motion of the Asteroids to be for some time defective, name-
ly, our inability to determine the action of these bodies in disturbing one
another. It is indeed certain that their masses are too small even for their
united attractive energy to have any sensible effect in disturbing the other
planetary bodies of the Solar System, all of which are situated at a consi-
derable distance from them. But with eachother it may bc otherwise. The
mean-distanccs in many instances differ so little from eachother and the
orbits are so interlaced that some of them can at times come extremely
near one another, and the effect of a very small body at a very short dis-
tance may be equal to that of a large body in a more remote position,
and thus it seems possible, that these little bodies may at times sensibly
disturb eachother. On this subject however nothing can with certainty bc
known or asserted untill some method be devised for ascertaining and taking
into account the masses of these little planets.

The excentricities and inclinations of the minor planets are in general
so considerable that the ordinary method of Laplace for determining the
perturbations cannot often be applied. Indeed that method, in order that

the disturbing function may be developable in a convergent form, requires
the condition*,

where J is the angle of inclination between the orbits of the disturbed and
disturbing planets. It therefore becomes necessary in most instances either
to employ the method of Hansen, which however no one would do till the
elements were well determined, or to have recourse to the Method of Me-
chanical Quadratures. This last has been the course universally adopted,
