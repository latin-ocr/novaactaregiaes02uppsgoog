The next of the discovered vertebrae or that which we take to be the

4ὓΙΙ candal vertebra (Pl. IX. figg. 82, 83) is, as we have already said,
similar to the 2³³, the only deviatione being that it is rather smaller, has
less lateral processes and a smaller foramen spinale. The concavity on
the under side of the eorpus, and on the sides beneath the lateral proeesses
is more marked. The articular areae for processus spinosi inferiores are
more distinet, aud from the outer side of both there extends inwards towards
the under side of the vertebra a ridge more distinet on this than on the
second. Dimensions of this vertebra: Breadth of eorpus 7—2—”3 height of dzo
in frent 6⁴¹3 length of d:o without epiphyses 3}¹¹3 length of processus spi·
nesus 2-2-”3 d:o of processus transversi 3—2-“3 breadth of deo 2}¹‘; distance
between extental borders of processus mammillares 33³⁴.
‚ The vertebra which we take to be the ὅθι candal vertebra (Pl. IX.

figg. 84- 85) presente generally the same form as the last, with the same
form and the same direction forward and downward of the lateral processa,
but differs sensibly from it by its smaller lateral praeesses, processus spi·
nesus, and foramen spinale ‚ and hy its thieker and more separated pro·
cessus mammillares. The transversal groove formed by the concavity below
and at the sides of the eorpus is deeper and narrower than in the preeee·
ding. Above the lateral proeesses there is also on the sides of the corpus
a deep concavity between the anterior and posterior borders. Dimensions
of this vertebra: Breadth of corpus in frent 7-2-“3 height of deo dso 6-}“;
length of dte, exclusive of epiphyses‚ &4⁴¹3 length of processus spinosus 2⁴⁴3
(lto of processus transversi 3-}¹¹; breadth of dzo 2¹⁴3 distance between externa!
borders of processus mammillares 43⁴¹.

Between the last described vertebra and· that which follows there is
so considerable a difference in the size of the processes‚ that they cannot
possibly have been eontiguous‚ and we are obliged to assume, that there
has been a vertebra between them ¹), whence it follows that we take the
vertebra represented in Pl. IX. figg. 86--87 to be the 81Ειι candal va·-
tebra. It is immediately evident that its processus spinosus is much lower,

 

 

⁸) 12 should here he remarked, that the gap between these vertebrae (figg.

84—86 and 85-87) has unfortunately‚ by an oversight, not been ohserved in the fi-
gures, where they have been placed in eontaet.
