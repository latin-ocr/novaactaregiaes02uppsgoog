is wiewed from behind (fig. 7) the articula-r surface for articulation with the
epistrophaeus appears almost in the form of a horse-shoe and undivided. It
does not extend so high up as the fossae condylo'ldeae and is at the middle
of the side parts a little convex. Dimensions of atlas: Breadth between the
extremities of the processus transversi 1‘ 53⁰3 length or thickness of the
sideparts (partes laterales) 3—1-''; length of processus transversi 3“; height
οἱ the same 4-3-''; height of atlas 123⁹. It is a sensible defect in our de-
scription of this skeleton that the epistrophaeus could not be included in it.

Tho 3rd cervical vertebra, viewed from behind, (Pl. Π. fig. 8) ¹) is
distinguished by the strong developement of the lower branch ot the lateral
processes (parapopbysis)‚ which is much larger than the upper (diapophysis)
and which, together with the latter, is inclined slightly backward. The
corpus is concave behind and convex is front, and of an almost rectangular
form, with the corners ronnded off, and with a notch in the upper back
border continued a little way downward as a shallow furrow. In the midst
of the corpus is a loW, blunt, longitudinal ridge. The arcus has a very
small processus spinosus, but is distinguished by its considerable height,
which is probably greater than in any other Balaenopteride, whence it ap-
pears ssiat the height of the foramen spinale is nearly equal to its traus-
versal measure ²).· The processus obliqui anteriores (Zygapophyses) are less
than the posteriores, but nevertheless distinct. The latter have tolerably
large concave articulat sui-faces. Both the upper and under branches of the
lateral processes‚ but especially the latter, are directed upwards‚ and the
former have the point divided‚ or running out into an upper and lower pro-
cess, of which the lower is directed to the upturned point of the lower
branch, and the inconsiderable distance between them has probably been
filled with cartilage. The corroded edges of these points show that they
have been longer, and therefore the distance between them less, when they
were entire3 bnt it is evident that the lateral processes neither of this nor
of the succeeding vertebrae have been annular. The upper branches have
at the base of the anterior side a projecting keel or crista. The lower,
larger branches are bent upwards‚ uneven at the lower border, at the hinder
part of the base they are provided with a little projecting border, are thiu
and compressed at the points, are also there higher than on the other parts, “

 

 

¹) We assume this on the ground of the uniform agreement of other Baleonop-

teridae in the size and direction of the lateral processes.

this whale.
