The entire number of the bone-fragments discovered amounts 1051.
Of these 12, including the vertebra in the possession of the-Royal Academy
of Sciences‚ are vertebrae apparently all belonging to the candal region, not
consecutive, but with several gaps between them 1); 16 vertebra-l epiphyses‚
that have been attached to the ends of these vertebrae, of which epiphyses
however two do not belong to the caudal region, but seem to have been
attached to the lumbosacral vertebrae3 the breast-bone‚ one bladebone, and
22 fragments of ribs. No rib is unbrokeu‚ and of the bits it has been
possible to put together only three riba, one of which is somewhat injured
at the lower end. Moreover 4 bits combine two and two into. two fragments
of ribs. The remainder are separate fragments which cannot be, put toge-
ther. The loose vertebral epiphyses‚ the very porcus ends of· the ribs‚ the
thick and very porcus upper 011ςο of the bladebone‚ the blunt and porcus
extremities of the vertebral processes‚ and the comparatively small. size of
the bones, all show that these bones belonged to a very young subject.
Nevertheless the arcus of the vertebrae is fully developed‚ and, as well as
the processes, firmly attached. The bones are not petrified‚ but still gene· ,
rally very hard, and some of them pretty heavy ‚ considerably heavier than
they would have been, especially since they are young and very spongy‚
if they had not so long lain in moist earth. On the vertebra‚- presented by
GYLLENHAL to the Royal Academy of Science‚ a little of the soil -in which
it lay remains still attached. evidently showing that that soil was clay.

The first of the discovered vertebrae (Pl. ΙΧ. figg. 78-81) seems to have
been either the 1ιιι or 2 nd caudal vertebra. There are marks of the articu-
lar surfaces for the processus spinosus inferior both in front aud behind, so
that the vertebra is more probably the 2⁸11. It has the lateral processes much
broader than 011 the next of those that have been found (fig-g. 82, 83), which
we take to have been separated from the other by one 1081 vertebra. Both
the processus spinosus and the processus mammillares are alike in both,
but the foramen spinale is · larger in the former. The lateral processes are
pretty much bent downwards, broader toward the end, and with a conca-
vity on the anterior edge at the base ‚ for the ascending branch of the aorta.
'Phe corpus has on the under side no longitudinal channel‚ but is on the
contrary transversally holloved both here and 011 the sides under the lateral
processes. Dimensions of this vertebra: Breadth of corpus in front 7-3—“3

¹) .A renewed examination of these vertebrae has caused to make certain mo-
dificatione in the explanation of them given in our Treatise on the Scandinavian
Cetacea.
