Between the saunas and floras of the Aretie and Antaretie regions, it
is generally known that there prevails. a certain correspondenee‚ so that one
not unfrequently meets in both with representatives of the same family ἃ
genus, but it is extremely rare to find in both representatives of the same
speeies, and the instanees hitherto recorded appear most generally the result
of eonfounding different speeies. As regards animalia vertebrata we with
certainty know of only one species ¹) common to both zones‚ and among land-
animals not one common distinguishing genus oeeurs. Among these the ge-
nera which are represented in both zones are in general of a cosmopolitieal
nature. It is among the inhabitants of the seas that we find examples of
an agreement between the zones. Within the class of Mammalia sueh an
example oeeurs among the Phoeidae in the genus C'ystophora NILSSON, al-
though that genus includes a speeies from the West-Indian seas. From
the Aretie Ocean we have the speeies (aystophm-az mistam (Erxl.) and from
the Antaretic Cystophora leonina (Lin.) or proboso-idea (Desm.) Nils., whieh
however has by J. Ε. GRAY, though apparently without sufficient reason,
been considered a separate genus, Monmya. Within the same class we
have among the Cetaeea the genus Delphinaptems or Beluya with two spe·
cies: D. leiwan (PALLAS) from the Aretie and D. Kinyz‘i (J. Ε GRAY) from
the Antaretie Ocean.

The femered vertebrata or birds whieh on their swist wiugs move
to distant naeus with great rapidity, not unfrequeutly afford, as might be
expected, examples of a very extensive geographieal dispersim, and we
find in the Aretie zone many speeies eommon to Europe, Asia and North
Ameriea, which have been termed eiromnpolars ‚ and others that are extended
from the polar eireles to the Equatorial regions. Nevertheless perham not

¹) Onu omonyma has been mentioned by D'Onsmnr as found at the Struit
of litigenae, but Gom.» considers it to be a different speeies and calls it Otus Gala-
paqoeneis as also oeeurring in the neighbourhood of the Galapagos Isles (Voyage of
Beagle³, but Senneessn has since (Museum des Pays-Bas) quoted that form, marking
it however with a note of interrogation, under the name of Otus braclcyotm. D’OR-
mour has also taken up the Proceuam’a qlaez'alis as found in the Str-ait of Magellan‚
but it has since been found to be of a distinet speeies, aud has even been referred
to another genus, ΊῚιαΙαωοίοα ΒΕΙΟΗΕΝΒΑΩΗ, Ἠιαὶωε. yhcialoidea Reieh. Bomp. D'On-
mom has further stated that Hir-:mdo rustica, urbica and aporia as well as Totam,
fumas are found in Patagonia‚ but in this also he appears to have eonfounded dif-
ferent speeies.
