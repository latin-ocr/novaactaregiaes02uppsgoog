trary pretty-f considerable differences from the foregoing‚ by a remarkable
reduction of the processes‚ as well the processus mammillares as the pr.
spinosus and‘ processus transversi. The foramina for the side-branches of
the aorta pass· through the base of the lateral processes in the same manner
as iu the prcceeding‚ but above the lateral processes there is on the sides
of the corpus a somewhat more visible concavity for the said side-brancha,
and *at the back edges of the arrcus is a deeper rounded notch for them
on their passing into the canalis spinalis. This notch is shallow and wide
in the preceeding vertebra. The half-canals between the front and back
articular processes for the processus spinosi inferiores are narrovcr. Dimen-
sious of this· vertebra: Breadth of corpus in front 7¹⁴3 height of d:o 6⁴}“3
length of d:o without epiphyses‚ 3⁴¹3 length of processus spinosus 1¹¹3 dzo
of prosessus transversi ξ”ς distance between external borders of procesm
mammillares 4⁴¹3 foramen spinale {³¹ broad and {¹¹ high.

’ The 13ίέιι candal vertebra (Pl. X. figg. 98, 99) differs from the fore-
going in the· ‘same manner as it differed from the 11⁹1, though comparati·
vely in a somewhat higher degree. The lateral processes are only indi-
cated by a longitudiual ridge over tbe side, and the base of them is per-
forated by the foramina for the side-branches of the sorta. The processus
mammillares are rudimentary as also the processus spinosus. The caud
for the· said branches in· the upper part of the sides of the corpus above
the laterai processes is deeper than in the foregoing vertebrae, and in this
the notches ·in the hinder borders at the base of the arcus have become
foramina. The foramen spinale is smaller than in the last. Dimensious of
this vertebra: Breadth of corpus in bont, exclusive of the said side-ridges,

Between the 13¹³ and the next of the discovered candal vertebrae there
is so great a differencc that we assume. that atleast one lost candal vertebra
has been situatcd between them. That which we accordingly take to be
the 15t¹1 candal vertebra (Pl. X. · figg. 100, 101) is entirely destitute of ridge
on the sides, as also of processus mammillares‚ aud has the processus spi·
nosus only slightly indicated. The foramen spinale is very small. The for-
amina or. ·channels for the branches of the sorta have the one opening above
the middle of the sides of the corpus, and the other far down in the sides,
and they have mol-cover an opening on each side of a large cavity on the
under side of the corpus. Over the upper opening is a short, open canal,
subsequently carried upward under a broad bridge and terminating in the
back part of the foramen spinale. Dimensions: Breadth of corpus in front
