on the former, and highest on the mter bmneh (α)· Thi· brunon has at

from the inner (h), which is moreover somewhat abortat and bmador.

The tail-feet of the last or gn. pair (Fig. 20, right foot) are shor-
ter, broader and more moveable. Their length is 8 millim. The stem is
almost rhomboidal‚ with the lower external angle projecting acutely. The
external terminal branch (a) is also somewhat longer than the internal (b) and
has also a detached spine at the point. Both branches have about the
same shape , are tolerably thiu , though thicker at the outer edge, of a
broad lancet form, and are provided with numerous bristles on the inner
border. Also the stem has similar bristles on its inner border and at the
outer and lower acute angle. These feet stretch somewhat behind the
ends of the other tail-feet and even somewhat further back than the 7 st·
tail-segment.

The 7 ¹¹ tail-segment or, as it is called, candal appendage (fig. 21)
is of considerable size, extending almost to the ends of the last tau-feet
Its length is 6 millim. It is forked a little below the middle, and the ope-
ning between the two halfs somewhat wider towards their termination. It
is tolerably thick with a blunt ridge which on both sides goes parallel with
and close beside the external edges of the lobes, with a hollow along the
middle between the base and the opening. The lobes are brought up
smoothly to points, and are destitute of the moveable spines at the end,
and no spines are visible on their sides.

 

The Group of the family Gammam‘dae, which the subfamily Lysia-
nassina constitutes, seems to be tolerably natural and well defined, bnt it
happens with it, as with many other natural groups, e. g. Felidae among
mammalia, Cypffnidae among fishes, etc.‚ that the forms belonging to it,
especially the different species within the same genus, not unfreqnently pre-
sent such slight differences, that it requires a very minute examination to
distinguish them. This group is distinguished by the form of the upper
antennae and mandibulae, the former having a peculiarly thick shaft of which
the two last joint-s are very short, and the latter a more or less sharp edge
with few or no teeth (fig. 52), and the inner process (a) — processus ac-
cessorius, BRUZELIUS - little or sometimes not at all developed. To this
may be added that the 2¹¹⁶ pair of truncal feet are very long and slender,
having in general a very small claw, which however is in one instance absent.
