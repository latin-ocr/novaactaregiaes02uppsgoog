processes are thinner at the point, less inclined baekwards, and have, when
viewed from above, the concavities at the base in the fore and hinder ed·-
ges about equal. Both this and the following vertebrae are without ridge
on the under side of the corpus.

The 3⁸⁶ lumbromcral vertebra (Pl. ΠΙ. figg. 21, 22, 23) likewise
closely resembles the first, hut its corpus has the upper edge of the fore
end straight, and the convexity, along the middle of the under side in
stronger3 the foramen spinale is smaller, and its hreadth greater than its
height3 the laterai processes stand out almost at right-angles, and the pro-
cessus spinosus both in this and the preceeding vertebra is very slightly
more inclined backwards than in the first. Dimensions of this vertebra:
Breadth of corpus 9-ξ-”; height of dzo 7}ss length of dzo 8}''; heigth of
the vertebra to top of processus spinosus 21⁰3 distance between extr-emities of
processus transversi 2‘ 11-41-”3 length of processus transversi 13'3 length
of processus spinosus about 12'3 distance between external edges of pro·
cessus mammillares 6'.

The lumborum-al vertebra, which we take to be the ὅθ’ is similar to
the 3¹·d above described, but has its laterai processes sensibly broader
(δ” broad, while those of the 3¹¹¹ are bnt δὲ’), and along the middle of the
under side of the corpus is an evident though not sharp ridge. In this as
also in the folloving vertebra the laterai processes are still a little inclined
backwards.

The 6¹²¹ lumborum-al vmobra (Pl. IV. figg. 24, 25, 26) is similar
to the 5⁰², bnt has the anterior end of the ’ corpus more rounded, with the
tsansversal dimension but inconsiderably larger than the height. The broader
part of die lateral processes extends more nearly to the base, and their
greatest breadth is in the middle ¹), aud the ridge along the middle ot the
lower side of the corpus is sharper. The &namen spinale is little, and some-
what broader than it is high. Dimensions of this vertebra: Breadth of cor·
pus in front 933 height of d:o 853 length of d:o 8-Ξ-”; distance between
the extremities of the latei-al· processes 3' 1''; length of right lateral pro·

The vertebrae, which we take to be the 9¹²¹ loth and 1ΙῦΙι lumboru-
mtl von-tebrae, are distinguished from the just described by a somewhat
higher corpus and by shorter lateral processes, standing out at right angles,
