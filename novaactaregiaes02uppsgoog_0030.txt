ΒΑΜ ¹) and Sauos BArn ²), who give to fflis gronp a wider range, lay
stress on the size of the epimert, (coxae, Β. ΒΑΤΕ), but this is no distin·
guishing feature, for there are others c. g. &meapham Pleu-tes, Odius et hm
(Otus S. ΒΑΤΕ) with equally large or larger epimera. DANA reckons up miseri, ·
as belonging to this under-family the genera: Lysianassa M. EDWARDS ,
Pheias Goliam-Mammam, Opis ΚΒὸΥΕΒ, Uristes Dm, Anonyoe mma
and Uromoe· DANA. From these we reject Pheias, [Mem and Urothoa the
two first on the ground that they have no flagellum appendiculam on the
upper antennae, and the last on that of its not having a thick shaft to the appel· ' ' ‘
antennas, and moreover that it nearly approaches the genus Pham ΚΒόΥΕΒ.. · · ·
SPENOE BATE includes in the snb-family of Lysianassidas the genera Lysia- euformis
nassa, Amnyoe. Pontoporeia KRUYER, Opis, Ichnopus Cos'rA, Caunum cosm,
Azibrotus M. EDWARDS, Hyals H. mmm, Phlius and Uristss. Of these
we reject Pomponia on account of the different form of the mandibula,
and the genera Alibrotus and Hyalo on account of the entirely different con·
struction of the upper antennae and second pair of feet. The genus Ich-
nopus appears to us identical with that of Lysianassa, and as regards Pheias
and Uristes we have ah·eady stated our opinion. We therefore include in
this sub-family only the genera Lysianassa, Anonyoe, Calli-soma and Opis,
to which we add the two new genera Eurytmos and Acidostoma. In order
to illustrate our view of the family Gammaridae and the underfamily Ly-
sianassina, we adduce here first a tableau of the families included in the
suborder Amphimala, and next a similar tableau of the sub-families com·
prised in the family Garamas-idae, and, as therewith connected, of the ge-
nera within the same family belonging to our-own fauna. We do this
the rather since no new synopsis of the kind has appeared since the year
1859 , when Doctor BRUZELIUS in Kongl. Wetenskaps-Akademiens Hand·
lingat, (new series) Vol. 3, p. 1. published his excellent paper ’'Bidrag till
kannedom om Skandinaviens Amphipoda Gammaridea'' (Contributions to the
knowledge of the Amphipoda Gammaridea of scandinavia). Our knowledge
of these crustacea has since that time received considerable additions from
the labours of Candidate A. ΒΟΕΟΚ, Professor M. Smne, and the observations
we have ourselves had the opportunity of making on the Western Coast of
Norway, and we can accordingly now include 36 genera as belonging to
our fauna, while BRUZELIUS has only 19. Of these genera 4 are new viz.
