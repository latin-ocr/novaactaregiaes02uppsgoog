is sharp aud cutting, it 18 probable ΕΜ 11 serves to divide the 101111, which
is afterwards ground by the tuberculum molare ι).

Τ118 first pair of maxillae (fig. 8) are also of a strong and solid cou-
struction, and their length about 7 millimetres. The outer branch ²) (a)
is, at the upper end (a¹)‚ spread out somewhat iu the manner of a haud,
hollowed 011 1118 11181118, 81111 81111811 at the edges with 11 stout moveable
spines‚ which with the exception of some few of thc longest are furnished
011 1118 0118 edge with side-prickles. The same branch’s iuner edge is also
bristled. The iuner branch (b) is thiu, sost, short, and broad, and has at
its point about 11 ciliated bristles. The palp (c) 18 two-jointed and rea-
ches beyond the point of the outer branch. The second joint is in the form
of a sabre and 1188 8 pair of short bristles at the point, as also 8 pair of

very small moveable pricklcs. These maxillae arc in immediate contact with
the mandibulae.

The 2“«1 pair of maxillae (fig. 9) are smaller thinner and of less
solid construction. Their length is 5 millim. They consist of two bran-
ches, and are of about the same obtusangular lancet-form, and the outer
(a) Ιχ, longer than the inner (b). Both have at the point and along the
inuer edge numerous ciliated bristles.

The maxillipcds (Fig. 3 9 q ἆ fig. 10) are 10 millim. long, and
consist 88 1181181 of a stem of 2 joints (fig. 10. a, b) 81111 of 8 palp (c). On
the inucr side of the 118881 joint of each maxilliped 18 811 oblong almost
truncatly terminated lamina (lamina interior) which at thc point and thc inner
border bears 8 number of longer bristles. These laminae (Fig. 1 1) come
into contact with eachother, and form by their uuion a raised ridge 011 1118
1111181· 81118 of the maxillipeds, and reach to 1118 81111 of thc first third of
the second joint's lamina. The second joint of thc stem (Fig. 10. b) is 011
the iuner fore-part expauded into a large almost elliptic lamina, the so called
lamina morior (fig. 3. ρ’. 9⁴ & fig. 10. θ), rounded off in front and there
furnished with bristles. Its Interior edge (fig. 12), is madc uneven by small

⁶ knobs. The Palp (fig. 3. 9'' μ’ 81111 fig. 10. c, c) consists of 4 joints of which

thc 2·ιὰ 18 1118 largest, 81111 1118 fourth 1188 1118 form of a claw, and all,
with the exception of the last, are furnished with numerous bristles.

¹) Spence Bate considers that this form of the mandibule indicates that the
animal consumes vegetable food.

²) The outer branch may be considered 88 the stem of these maxillae.
