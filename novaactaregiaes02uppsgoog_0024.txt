process. The 4¹1¹ truncal segment's epimera, which are ὼε largest, ue
almost rhomboidal with the corners rounded off, aud with a wide hellew
at the upper and back corner. The 5³¹¹ pair of epimera are almost rect-
angular with the corners rounded off, and a little hollow in the middle of
the lower edge, into which hollow the upper edge of the δώ pair of feet’s
second joint is inserted. The epimera of the lzst tan-segment have the
lower and back corner rounded off, aud those of the 2¹¹⁶ seg-ment have
the same corner extented into a short point, from which on the outer side
of the epimera a tolerably sharp edge or ridge ‹Figz 21) stretches itself
obliquely upwards and forwards. The 4⁸¹¹ tall-segment's epimera have at
their lower extremity a large spine turned backwards.

The eyes are not visible and have accordingly not been introduced
in the figure of the animal, but seem, judging from the inner portione, to
have been large and kidney- οι· home-shaped, and red.

The head (fig. 2) is somewhat couvex, the forehead almost trun-
cated, aud has in the middle only an obtuse angle, as a slight indication
of a rostrum. On the sides of the head is a projecting obtuse-angled lobe
between the upper and lower antennae. The hollow under that lobe is ter-
minated at its lower extremity by a projecting process.

The shaft of the upper-antennae is short, and its first joint longer
than the two following together, and the 2¹¹⁰ a little longer than the third.
The flagellum consists of about 27 joints, the first of which is a little shorter
than the shaft, and has on the iuuer side numerous long thickly set bristles
of a brownish colour. The flagellum when laid back reaches about to the
middle of the 2¹¹ss thoracal segment. The flagellum appendiculare or ap-

pendage, which is but litttle shorter thau half the flagellum, consiste of 9
joints of which the first is the longest.

The lower-antennae are more thau doubl'e as long as the upper, and
their flagellum consiste of about 56 joints furnished with long ί bristles on
the under-side. The first joint in their shafts (F ig. 1 ἃ 2, ὂ’) is espe-
cially large and distended, and for the greatest part of its length unpro-
tected by the head-shield. The 2ῐιᾱ segment of the said shaft has on its
underside evidently a sharp process. (²²01factory denticle‚'’ S. ΒΔΤΕ).

The upper and underlips (Fig. 3, c ἆ fig. 4 ἀ 5), which are about
5 millim. long, are of a very complicated construction. The former consti-
tutes the central piece (a) and the latter the two side pieces (b, b) which
are united at the base so as to be in some degree moveable, and can ap-
