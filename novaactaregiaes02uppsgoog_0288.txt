ef the lefl: lateral process, and immediately over the hole through the base
of the right lateral process i a short chanuel directed backward3 because
the foramen spinale is very small aud transversally rounded off, and because
the channel along the middle of the under side of the corpus is both broad
and especially in its hinder part deeply concave, and there appears also in
the middle of the under side a broad transversal groove. The latei-al pro-
eesses are quite short, but directed forwards‚ and their hinder angle strongly
rouuded off. Viewed from the ends the corpus is almost round, with the
transversal dimension rather greater than the height, The sides are pretty
deeply concave between the edges‚ both above and below the lateral pro-
eesses. The processus mammillares are much decayed‚ but one can see
that they were small and blunt. The processus spinosus is turned back·
ward, with the point rouuded off and decayed. Dimensions of this vertebra:
Breadth of corpus 1133 height of d:o 9{³'3 length of dzo 833 length of left
latei-al process 253 breadth of d:o 5}''; height of vertebra to top of processus

δῖ. Right lateral process imperfect.

In consequence of the great difference in the size of the corpus, as
well as of the processes‚ between our assumed 9²¹² candal vertebra and the
next succeeding of those discovered, we are compelled to assume that there
has been a loth, now lost, between them.

The llffi-l'lffi, 190¹, 20& candal vertebras (Pl. VLfig.43) display the
usual rapid diminution of the hinder caudal vertebrae, as well with respect to
the corpus as the arcus and processes , which latter both at last altogether
disappear. They also undergo considerable changes with respect to the
foramina for the side branches of the aorta. On the three first we find the
arcus and decayed remains of the processus mammillares‚ and on the two
first the lateral processes are distinctly visibles‚ with the anterior angle {or-
ming a projecting point. In all three the foramen spinale at the back part
diminishes rapidly in sizo, and in the third is very small. On it (the 13³¹)
the only indication of the lateral processes is a bump extending longitudi-
nally over each side. The foramina ‚ through which the above-mentioued
right and left branches of the aorta pass, have even in the pt (the 11ffi)of
these vertebrae their origin on each side of the deep longitudinal canal on
the under side of the corpus, and have their openings on the 11ιιι and 12ῒ·ιι
vertebrae above the base of the lateral processes, and on the 13th above
the bump that occupies their place, and over that opening is a bridge‚
under which the said artery passes. This bridge is narrowest in the 11⁶¹
and broadest in the 13th, In the 14¹¹·h these foramina have their upper
