rences requires greater critical accuracy than it has been hitherto usual to
bring to the subject, as also that the distinguishing characteristics require
the setting up of a greater number of generic groups and even families.
The Wahlebone Whales are divided into 2 families: Balaenidae, without
and Balaenoptmidae‚ with dorsal fin. Under the first of these families are
classed 5 or 6 and under the last 8 genera. Ten different species are
considered as belonging to the former, of which however one (Balaam
ρίὁόοεα, ERXL.) is very uncertain, and one (Palaeocetus Sedywstffl, SEEBY)
only is found as a fossi13 and to the latter family belong 24 different species,
some of which appear however tobe uncertain, and therefore have been.
classed as such. We may in the mean time look upon it as certain, that the
number of known species will much increase in proportion as our knowledge
of the whales found in the North Pacific and Antarctic Oceans approaches
pei-fection. In the above-named work of GRAY the greatest part of the cha-
racteristics are derived from the skeleton, as being the part which is most
easily accessible for the Mnseums, and can thus be most frequently made
the object of a naturalists study, and which indeed doubtless aflords the best
marks of distinction. N evertheless, as far as our present knowledge extends,
variations in the structure of the skeleton are always accompanied by varia-
tions in the external form of the body, which shows that also these latter pe·
culiarities are deserving of attention, and that it is requisite, in order to gain
a full and certain diagnosis of the different species, to possess a knowlege
not only of the animal’s skeleton but also of the form of the body. Some-
times in the absence of better indicatione good characteristics have been
derived from the whiskers, as for example, in the case of the Balaena
maryinata, GRAY. As Prof. GRAY in this work has not only set forth the
results of his own extensive observations of Cetacea in general, but has
also collected and arranged whatever is new and important in the commu·
nications of others, he has made this. “Catalogue“ a general synopsis of
that whole order of Mammals‚ in the study of which the work thus becomes
an indispensable standard. ·

The treatise on the N orthem Whale published by the late Prof.
Escnmon'r aud Prof. J. REINRARDT has the merit of being the, most minute
and elaborated monography on the subject of any special kind Whalebone
Whale that we possess, and accordingly offers, while fully going into the
natural history of that Whale, a worthey example and good guide for anyone
who may wish to give out a monography of any other kind of Whale.
The first of these gentlemen had the intention of publishing a detailcd de-
scription of the Nordcaper or Biscayo·Whale, but before he could carry
