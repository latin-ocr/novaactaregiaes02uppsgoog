In the above cited work on the Oetacea af scandinavia ¹) 1 have
given a detailed account of the circumstances under which the Whale-bones
here described were found: that the field in Graes, Roslagen‚ where the
bones were dug up, lies 10-15 feet above, and 840 feet distant from the
sea3 that they lay partly in sand and partly in clay, at a depth of from 2
to 4 feet3 and that with them were found 8110118 of the Mytilus ululis and
Tellena balthica of· precisely the same appearance as those now met with
¹ in the Baltic.

J. GRAY states ²) that he has received from the shores of the English
Channel a pair of cervical vertebrae of this Whale‚ which had been throwu
011 shore by the waves at Babbicombe Bay. He has appended a figure of
the one of them, which presente a close agreement with the above deseri-
11οᾶ 111 1110 form of the corpus and direction of the latera] processes, but,
as it is destitute of arene, the identification cannot be considered 88 abso-
lutely certain.
