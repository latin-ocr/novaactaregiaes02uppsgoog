above which they have a long processus spinosus, and they are ridged
along the middle of the under side of the corpus. There is very little
difference between them, except that the 9th has the largest and the
llth the smallest lateral processes. The 10th (Pl. IV. figg. 27 , 28, 29)
has the corpus, when viewed endways (fig. 29) almost] round, but the
· transverse dimension a little greater than the height. The lateral processes
are broad in proportion to their length, and the left appears to stand more
straight out from the side than the right, but this latter has been conside-
rably corroded in the front border nearer the extremity. The processus
mammillares are thin and the processus spinosus, viewed from the side, narro·
wer towards the end , even allowing for the circumstance that the anterior
border is in that part somewhat imperfect. The foramen spinale is small,
and its breadth and height about equal, its form triangular, with an inward-
directed flexure in the sides near the upper angle. Dimensions of that ver·
tebra: Breadth of corpus 9333 height of d:o 8333 length of d:o 93¹3 distance
between extremities of lateral processes 2' 8'‘; length of right lateral pro·

ween external borders of processus mammillares 6”·.

In consequence of the differenoes that appear between the assumed
llth lumbosacral vertebra and that which we take to be the 1⁵¹t candal ver-
tebra, ve assume that there have been 3 more lumbosacral vertebrae, situ·
ated between the above mentioned, and accordingly that there were 14 ver-
tebrae belonging to the lumbosacral region.

The 1⁸⁴⁵ candal vertebra (Pl. IV. figg. 30, 31, 32) differs from the
llthl lumbosacral in that the corpus is hig-her and the ridge on its lower side
is blunt and terminates at the posterior extremity with a concave surface with
two articulat sus-faces (fig. 31 , a) for the processus spinosus inferior (haema-
pophyses), that the foramen spinale is less, that the lateral processes are
shorter and slightly inclined forward, but inserted lower down on the sides
ot the corpus, and directed decidedly downwards. Its processus spinosus
has probably been shorter ²). Viewed from the front end (fig. 32), the corpus
has the upper border, making the base of the oval-rounded foramen spinale‚
straight, but short. The upper lateral borders below this are long and but
little curved‚ so that this end does not display a regularly rounded form.

¹) The left is much shorted, being much corroded about the extremity.
²) It corresponds to the vertebra that by Escnmcnr and Ramnsnm· (“on
the Northern Whale“) has been considered as the last lumbosacral.
