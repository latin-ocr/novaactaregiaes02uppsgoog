34 W. meoac,

The lower arm-bones (radim aad alna) (Pl. VIII. fig. 64, the right)
are in form not quite so elongated as those bones usually are in Balaenop-
midae, but in other respecta present nothing remarkable, except that the
ulna has a very large olecrauon‚ conically pointed at the upper part. Both
have the anterior edge convex and the posterior concam, and the lower
end of the radius reaches below that of the ulna. The rectilinear length of
the radius is 2· 5}⁴¹; that of the ulna between the articulat surfaces 2¹ 2÷⁴¹3
breadth of radius in the middle 6-2-“3 d:o of ulna 4¹¹.

of the carpel-bones or bones of the carpus six have been found (Pl.
VH. figg. 65-70), of which however one is very small and has only one
surface complete. As they vere found in the immediate neighbourhood of the
right lower-arm·bones it seems probable that they belong to the right pec-
toral fin. The same is the case with the four metacarpal bones that have
been discovered (figg. 7 1-7 4) , and the four phalanges that have been
found, and of which the three are here represented (figg. 75-7 7). The
motacavpal-bones are comparatively short and thick ‚ aud have probably
had their respective positione from the innermost to the outermost in the
order indicated by the numerical series, and the number of fingers was
accordingly only 4, as in other Balaenopteridae. Their respective length:
are: N:o 71 5-2-“3 N:o 72 6-,“-“; N:o 73 53³⁴ and N:o 74 53¹·“· The phazmqn
(figg. 75-77). It is scarcely possible to &sign to these their respective
positione. Resides the 3 here represented a 4¹²³, as we have already inti-
mated‚ has been found. It is exactly like the largest of these. The length
of this last is ὅθ’, that of the next in size 5-2u, and that of the smallest δὲ’.
The two largest are comparatively thicker‚ and the section through the
middle is rival, but the two smaller ones are more flattened‚ and from this
we may conclude that they have been situated farther from the base of the
singem, whereas the larger ones were probably hasal-phalanges. -

We may conclude from the preceeding description that, among the
discovered bones ‚ the under jaw-bones ‚ the cervical vertebrae, the eternum
and scapula are those whick present the distinguishing festines of the Ge·
nus Bactrianam, which has been constituted by J. Ε. GRAY for this Whale.
We therefore characterize that genus as follows:
