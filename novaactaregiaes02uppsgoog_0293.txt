The breast-bone (sternam) (Pl. VH. fig. 60) 18 much decayed, but
seems to have preserved its characteristic form, which also furnishes a di·
stinguishing markos this Whale. It is concave at the anterior edge, with
a broad obliquely cut winglike projection on= both sides of the front, and
running out behind into a long round pin or process· At the base of this
projection on either side, obliquely opposite to 88811011181, 18 811 rough pro·
8888 , which in all probability served to fasten the cartilage, wich united
the 1⁸¹⁵ rib to the breast-bone. The upper side is concave and the lower
somewhat convex‘ Its length is 11}¹¹, the breadth between the “ends of the
winglike projections 1¹ -}‘⁴. ’ f

The bladebone (scapula) (Pl. V111.fig. 61, 62) is also characteristic
of this Whale. lt is not so broad as in other Balaenopteridae, though not
much less than that of the Meyapterffi but broader than that of the Balae-
nidae, and seems in that respect to stand between the two forms Its breadth
at the upper part is greater than the length from the cavitas glenoidalis to
to the upper edge by nearly -ξ of the former. It is hollowed out in the
middle of the outer side. The acromion 18 broad and large, and the
processus coracoideus, though much shorter than the acromion, is yet tole-
rably long and thick, with the point rounded off. The cavitas glenoidalis,
viewed en face, is almost rhomboidal. The spina scapulae extends upward
against to the upper edge, and near-er the acromion its border is far in
front of the other edge of the bladebone. The bones length is 2 8-1-“3 its
breadth 3¹ 62³¹. Breadth of collum 1⁴. Acromion 9⁴¹ long, and processus
coracoideus 5:⁴¹.

The os humeri (Pl. VIII fig. 63,1118 left, seen from the outside) is
like that of the Balaenopter'idae in· general, and somewhat more elongated
than that of the Balaenidae, and has a caput subterminale and not so obli·
quely directed as in these last· A part of the tuberculum majus is lost,
and that protuberance seems n'ot to have been particularly large. ‘The an-
terior edge, (xpina tuber-culi majoris), which goes directly down from the
tuberculum majus to the lower end, is tolerably sh arp, and the corpus of
the bone has a rather compressed form. Lower down and on the outer side
of the anterior border is ‘a tolerably deep hollow, and on the outer side
nearer the upper end there is a low crista passing obliquely over the middle
of the bone. On each side· of the articulat surfaee for the upper end ‘of
the ulna is a ridge or crista and the inner of these is at its back part
divided into two by 8 81118118. The two articular surfaces for the radius
and ulna form a very obtuse angle with eachother. The length of the bone

is 1⁴ 9-;-⁴⁴; its breadth at the upper end 11-2-“3 dzo at the lower 113¹-⁴¹.
