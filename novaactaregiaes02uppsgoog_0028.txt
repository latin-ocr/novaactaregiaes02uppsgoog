16 W. Lamnae,

in having the 2⁰⁴¹ joint strongly expanded, and in being directed forwards.
The foot of the 6⁸¹¹ pair here represented is 24 millim. long. The ὀύ· pair,
as may be seen in fig. 1, is distinguised by having the 1²³t Joint larger,
and the back part somewhat higher than the foreparu which is almost semi-
circular. The second joint is shorter, and has the posterior spreading
portion almost semicircular. In those of the 61¹¹ pair this joint is rounded
ovally, and the border rough with indentations or notches. These inden-
tations are only slightly apparent in the 5³¹¹ pair. At the base of the la-
mina for covering the eggs, attached to these last mentioned feet the fe-
male genital aperture is very clearly apparent. The 71¹¹ pair of truncal-feet
difler from both the preceeding in having the 2ηιί joint longer and oval,
with small but clearly visible indentations in the back border.

Each pair from the 2¹¹d to the δι’] inclusive is provided with laminae
for covering the eggs, all of the same form as that, which is represented
in our plate, and which belong to the 2⁰d pair: the 6⁸¹¹ and 71¹¹ pairs are
destitute of this appendage. In the 2¹¹0, ΒΜ and 4¹¹³ pairs the gill-sack is
of the same form (fig. 14 c). In the 5th and ΘΗ] pairs it presente the same
form (fig. 17), but differs from the preceeding in being of a firmet structure,
and having a caecum-like appendage (b) containing granulated matter, con-
sisting of fat globuli and other formative particle& In the 7 ‘¹¹ pair this
appendage is wanting, but in other respects its gill-sack is similar to that
of the foregoing pair.

The tail-feet of the first 3 pair's‚ or so-called swimming-feet, are
of the usual form (fig. 18, 1et pair, right foot) and are similar to eachother
excepting that they diminish in size‚ so that the 3 “¹ pair are shorter than
the foregoing. They consist of a strong, oblong stem, (a) tapering towards
the lower end, and two terminal branches (b, b) tapering gradually to a point,
longer than the stem, composed of a great number of joints, and on both
sides provided with long ciliated bristles. The 1st pair are 19 millim. long.

The tail-feet of the last 3 pairs (i. e. the 4³¹, 5³¹¹ ἀ 6⁰¹) are as
usual formed for leaping, and consist of a stem and two simple terminal
branches without swimming-bristles. The 2 first pairs are as nearly as
may be similar to one another, but are longer and have their terminal
branches more pointed than those of the 6ὼ pair. Those of the 4¹¹¹ pair
(Fig. 19, right leg, outer side) are somewhat longer and slenderer than
those of the δὼς their length is about 14 millim. Along the outside of the
stem there is a raised ridge, and a similar elevation runs along the middle
of both terminal branches both on the outer and inner side, though higher
