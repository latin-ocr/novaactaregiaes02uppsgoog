and broader in the lower part rather nearer the lower end, than in the
4²1¹, as is the case also iu a higher degree in the 21¹d pair3 and as besides
the next pair, with which it might be confounded, have been found entire,
we conceive that we have full right to consider this fragment as belonging
to the 31⁴³ pair.

The 4³¹¹ pair qt rib-³ (Pl. VI. fig. 50, the left) is distinguished by*
considerable length 8οᾶ greatness, especially in the upper part, and more-
over by a complete capitulum collum 8οᾶ tuberculum. They are also much
cua-ved at the upper end. Their collum is 7 ” long. They are the largest
of all, though the sncceeding pair is but little less, 8οᾶ in length surpasses
ffiem. At about the beginning of the upper third of their length they have
ou the outer border a very slightly marked obtuse angle, between which
and the tuberculum they are very broad. The tuberculum is about 2⁹ high,
and the collum almost triangular in cutting through.

The ὅθι pair ⁰f ribs is similar tho the last but rather slighter and
longer, 8¹ along the outer curve, and has somewhat shorter collum.

The ssth pair of rrZs· (Pl. VI. fig. 51, the lest) are slenderer than
the foregoing and 8 little longer3 also they are broader in the upper part
and with a more or less marked angle in the upper edge at that part They
have also a disn'nct collum 01· capitular process, but it is much smaller‚
aud the capitulum is scarcely perceptible Those of this pair are the lon-
gest of all the found ribs.

The ’71ιι pair of rios (Pl. VI. fig. 52, the left) are slenderer and
somewhat shorter than the preceeding, with the upper 0οᾶ coucam, and
only a slight indication of a capitular process. They have the upper third
8 little broader, with 8 scarcely perceptible notch or angle in the outer
berder. · ’
The 8³¹ pm’r os n'bs (Pl. VI. fig. 53, the left) is somewhat less than
the foregoing, 8οᾶ is, like those which follow, entirely destitute of capi·
tular process . but has however the upper end concave.

The θῶ pair of riba (Pl. VI. fig. 54, the left) is almost exactly si-
milar to the last but a little ebor-ter, 8οᾶ 1188 8 pair of obtuse angles in
the outer bordei· of the upper part, 8οᾶ the upper end but slightly concave.

The 10th pair qf rios (Pl. VH. fig. 55, the right) is far shorter than
the θῶ, 8οᾶ 1188 the upper end somewhat sqare, with a longitudinal shallow
concavity both on the front and back surfaces in that part. It has also
some bumps, of which one near to the summit, between the anterior and
exterior side, is the largest.
