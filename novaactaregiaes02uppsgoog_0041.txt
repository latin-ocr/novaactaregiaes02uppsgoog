On rm: Lrsmusu nummulos nro. 25

This species is easily recognized by the following characteristics.
The 1¹⁸t pair of feet have the 3³¹ ⁸ioiut as long as or longer than half of
the ἓως the claw is mmcd at the inner edge with a strong tooti13 the edge
of the hand, to which the claw is attached is furnished with a row of ex·
tremely fine spinea arranged like the teeth of a comb, within which are
scantily set bristles; and last the 3rd tail-segment has the lower back angle
but little drawn out, but acute. The processus accessorius of the mandibula
is particularly prominent, and on one side provided with teeth.

In very young individuals the 3rd joint of the 1⁸¹t pair of feet is shor-
ter than half of the second, and they closely approach the A. nanoides,
from which however they may be distinguished by the abovementioned pair
of feet beeing longer and slenderer, and by the fore and back borders of
the hands being somewhat curved but not convergent‚ as in the latter spe-
cies. The carpus of the 2 ¹¹⁶ pair of feet is not quite double as long as
the hand.

This species occurs on our west coast from Bohuslan to Finmar-
ken‚ and is extended northward to Greenland and southward to England.

It is probably this species that R. BRUZELms (1. c.) has described un·
der the name of Anonyoe nauus Kroyer with a note of interrogation. In his
description he has omitted the minute denticle on the inner side ot the claw
of the 1 ⁸ pair of feet.
