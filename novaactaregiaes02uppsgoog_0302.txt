ovally ronnded in the section (fig. 110). At the 11111101 0011 this rih.also

The two pieccs of 11110, each consisting of two fragments, belong to
the left side, and 1110 11110, of which they have formed a part, have been
narrower and longer than those above described. The longest, which is
also narrowest, is almost round at both ends, and it, as well as the other
fragment, belongs to the middle part of the rib, both the upper and lower
ends being lost. The narrower‚ measured along the external curvatum, is

The blado-bom (scapula) (Pl. XI. figg. 112, 113, the left) is also of
the highest importauce in classifying this Whale. All the cartilaginous por-
tions that were ataehed to this bone are lost. The acromion is tolerably
long, 1101 110 thick, abruptly truncated and spongy exn-emity shows that it
had a cartilaginous continuation, and accordingly is not fully developcd.
The processus coracoidens 10 absent, but the capnt scapulae shows 01 1110
anterior angle (a) an ascending rough surface, which has no doubt served
for 1110 fixing of this process as yet in a cartilaginous state, for it, as is
well known , is much later developed than the acromion. On this ground
we assume that this species 10 provided with a processus coracoidens. Both
the form and position of the acromion 111 11110 Whale differ from those which,
