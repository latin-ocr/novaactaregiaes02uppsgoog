The processus spinosus is tolerably high and directed backward. The pro-
cessus obliqui anteriores et posteriores are plainly visible, and out-side the
former are tolerably high proJecting processus mammillares (A. Rmzms).
The foramen spinale is subtriangular, and the transversal dimension cousi-
derably greater than the height. The lateral processes are short and thick,
and the epiphyses are firmly attached to the corpus. Dimensions of this

The dor-sal vertebrae which we take to be the 5¹¹¹, ssth and ’Ν1 were
found lying together with the ends of their corpora in their natural position.
The δῶ and 'Yth agree accurately with the δῶ as here represented, (Pl. Π.
figg. 14 and 15), aud they differ from the third by their larger size‚ lou·
ger projecting neuralspine, and longer and broader lateral processes, which
in all point backward.

The 5³¹ differs from the other two in having its lateral processes
shortcr and less inclined backward, in being broader over the processus
mammillares, and in having a broader foramen spinale. The ’ἰῐ11 differs from
the δῶ only in having slightly longer· lateral processes, and anarrower fora-
men spinale. The epiphyses are loose on all three. They are also looso
ou the succeeding dorsal vertebrae and on the two first lumbar vertebrae.
We may therefore, according to FLOWER, consider this skeleton as that of
a whale in the 2nd or “adolescent“ period of life.

Th δῶ dorsal vertebra (Pl. H. figg. 14 and 15), which we shall
describe separately, has a corpus, when viewed endwise, rounded oval,
with the transverse dimension greatest, and the upper edge slightly concave.
Its sides, as well as the upper surface, are concave and smooth between
the edges‚ and its under side strongly convex longitudinally in the middle,
but not ridged. The foramen ·spinale is almost halfround, with the trans-
versal dimensioni greater than the height. The processus mammillares are
compressed‚ oblong, strongly projecting‚ aud, as well astho processus obli-
qui anteriores‚ completely separated from the base of the lateral processes,
but united with the base of the arcus. The processus spinosus (neuralspine)
is high, much inclined backwards, cut off obliquely at the point, with roun-
ded corners, and with the front sharp edge concave, when viewed from
the side, and with the point something broader. The lateral processes arc
flattened with somewhat thicker points, and there on the under side and
nearer the posterior angle, provided with a concave articulating cavity for
the costa. Viewed from above these processes arc considerably broader at
