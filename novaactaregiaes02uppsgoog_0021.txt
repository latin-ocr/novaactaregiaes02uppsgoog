poirofthetmnoal §eenhave aclaw. Ifweanitcthc two genera, the
geographica distribution will require some little modificatiom as boeoming
somewhnt 1888 arctic or antarctic. Of the 13 species of the genus Lycio·
nam 2 are from Grecnland and Norway‚ 7 from the Mediterranean, the
Atlantic, England and Norway, 1 from Van Diemens Land, 1 from thecape
of Good Hope, and 2 from Rio Janeiro. None of these species is common
to both the arctic and antarctic 8888. We have not included the Lyda-
ποκα maydlaniea in this calofflafiom because, as we in the following pages
shall show, it constitutes the type of a separate genus. In fact the Cirri-
peds are the only other order, in which we have examples of species com-
mon to both these zones, for the Lepas Hillii and fascicularis‚ which are

spread over the whole carth (DAme), are also found in both the above
mentioned zones.

The genus Glyptonocus has been formed by EIGTHS ¹) to define a gi·
gantic species of the Idotheidae, found in South Shetland, which approaches
the Idothea entomon and is accordingly generically united with it and with the
Idothea Sabini. It has been called Glyptonotus antarctica Emms (according
to ΒΑΜ). This genus, the geographical distribution of which 18, 88 we
have before stated, confined to the polar tracts, although the one species,
Glyptonotus entomon (Lm), as a. relic of an extinct glacialfauna (S. Lovfiu),
is still occasionally found in more southern parts, as for instance in the
Baldo, accordingly presents a most striking and remarkable example of the
coincidence of disposition that exista between the two marine polar faunae.
The consideration of this lessens in some degree our astonishment, at the
discovery of so higly developed 8 species as the Lysianassa mayellanica
common to both the arctic and antarctic zones.

Professor ΤΗ. FROES has been kind enough to furnish us with some
information relative the Flora of the arctic and antarctic Zones , which we
here communicate, as being a valuable assistance in judgeing of the relation
between the Faunae of these Zones. ”Among the vegetable productionis of
antarctic America there are not 8 few found that also belong to the Flora
of Europe. The greater part of these however consist of such easily ac-
climatized species as Senecio vulyariss, T aramacum οῄἳσίπαίο, δοτιοήιιε olm-a-
ccus, Galium aparine, Brassica campestris, Capsella bursa pastoris, Stellam
modia, Urtica arem etc, which are now found, one may say, spread over
the whole world. Among the vegetables which cannot be referred to this
