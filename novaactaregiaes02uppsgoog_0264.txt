During a 8011181 period 8. 8. 1118 Northem Whale (Balaam mysticam) has
visited our Scandinavian 8888, 8811 during a milder period these waters have
doubtless been the resort of more southern species. The time, at which
one of the species we have at present under review (Eschriohtim robustus),
visited our seas, seems not to have been very distant, and the character
of the shells, found in the neighbourhood of the bones, shows that the
surrounding water was 111811 88811 88 11 18 nom We have unfortunately not
been able to examine the earth strata at the spot where the other species
(Huntm‘m Svedenboryii) was found, but the epoch, at which the 110888 were
there imbedded, is without question far more ancient3 and the structure of
the skeleton indicates a nearer relationship with those species, which now
belong to the milder 8888, 8811 088 would accordingly seem justified in assu-
ming that the bones were imbedded when the temperature was higher than
when the Northem Whale (Balaena mysticetus) was found 11818, that is to
say, not under the 80 8811811 188-11811011. We may probably attribute it to
the period, when the European Marsh·Tortoise (Emys Europaeasossilis) was
met with here at least as far north as East Gothland.

Among the contributions to a more accurate knowledge of the Whale-
bone Whales that have been made in later times, we would signalize the
following works: “Catalogue of Seals and Whales in British Museum“ by
J. Ε. Gmm ”Om Nordhvalen ⁸(Balaena mysticam L.)“, by D. F. Escnmcm·
and J. REmHARDT 18 1118 Royal Danish “Videnskabs-Selskabs“ Transactions

skeletons of Whales in the principal Museums of Holland 81111 Belgium, with
descriptions of two species apparently new to science“‚ by W. H. FLOWER,
in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1864. Also a work
small in extent but remarkable for accuracy and fullness of detail: “On a
Whale of the Genus Phymzus GRAY, captured in Orkney“, by Romam
HEDDLE, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society 1856, 88 8180 “Be-
skrifvelse af 811 ved Lofoten indbjaerget Rorhval, Balomoptm mamalum& by
G. Ο. SABS, in the Norwegian “Videnskabs Selskabets Forbandlinger“

In the first-named very valuable work of Prof. J. E. GRAY (Cata-
logue of Seals and Whales &c.), based upon the rich materials afforded by

means so destitute of resource of different “forms“ or species, as 11811 11888
previously for the most part supposed, and that the study of the diffe—
