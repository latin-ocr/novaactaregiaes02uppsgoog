opening on the upper side uf the eorpus, nt the outer side of the bue of
a low elevation or tuber there situated, between which two tubera ‚ in the
uidet of the' vertebras upper eide, is a longitudinal narrow and deep fossa,
instead of a foramen spina-le. In the 15111, 16111, 17111, 191111 and 20³1 they have
their upper opening in the corresponding plaee, but on the three last there ie
an open channel connecting them, and they have their lower opening oimated
in the same place ae in the foregoing, in a common fossa. The 16111 and
17111 as well as the 192² and 20⁰1 have, when viewed from the fore end,
a eubquadrangular form, with the cornere rounded off. The 14& and 15111
are more decidedly ronnded off at the upper part. In all the candal verte·-
brae the epiphysee are firmly attached. On the 15111 and 16111 the laet traces
ct* the articula· audaces for the processus spinosi inferiores are yet visibleS.

Between the 17111 and the next of the discovered vertebrae there ie
oo great difference of dimensione, that it is evident, that there has been
an 18111 vertebra between them, which hae not been found, and it appears
ae if the three exn-erne candal vertebrae were lost, and it seems therefore
probable that the candal vertebrae were in all 23, eo that the whole number
of vertebrae, including the 7 cervical, the 15 dorsal and the 14 lumbosaeral
vertebrae , wne 59 or about 60.

The 19111 and 20111 candal vertebrae are in the middle of the ends,
especially on the anterior eide, very deeply hollowed.

three are here represented PL VI. figg. 44, 45, 46. The largest, fig. 44,
