we may approximatively estimate the entire length of the skeletou at about
45—-50 feet.

In proportion to the length of the skeleton the ribs are thick and
large, the length of the longest being about -ζ- of the skeletons. This pro-
portion shows that the form of the body was slender and elongated, most
like that of the Physalus musculus, 111 which the longest rib is a trifle less
than -ξ- of the skeletons length, i. e. in the case of an old male (Bergeus
museum); slenderer than that of the Balamoptm rostrata, where that length
in a younger specimen is about midway betwen -ξ- and 3¹,- of the skeletons,
and in. a still greater degree slenderer than that of the Meyaptera Imp-³,
where the same length is about -ξ- of the skeletons. Its bone-framework 16
however stout and strong, on which account we have given it the specialname
robusta. In form the ribs in general agree most with those of the Physalm
musonem, but are comparatively something stouter and broader, and in that
respect exhibit a tendency towards the form they have in the Balaena, to
which ‚genus they approximate also 111 the circumstance of the two pairs
having a more strongly developed collum 111611 any other Balaenopterid ,
61111 were possibly, fastened by their capitula to the corpora vertebrarum. All
have the lower end tapefing, but more or less thin and compressed‚ and
those that are foremost are pretty broad just above the tapering point, with
tolerably sharp edges. From the number of them that have been found, as
well as from the ordinary normal continuone change, which they show
among themselves, we may with the greatest probability infer, that their
number was 15 pairs, of which the first pair only is totally wanting. In 611
Whalebone Whales the first pair is broadest at the lower end, and as the
first pair of the *discovered ribs of this whale has the lower end tapering,
we are compelled 10 assume that these not are the first pair in the skeleton.
As these ribs are very similar 10 1116 2¹²<l pair of the Physalas musculus, we
consider that we are justified in assuming them to be that pair.

The 2⁰11 pair of ribs (Pl. VI. figg. 47, 48) 616 distinguished from
the following by greater breadth in proportion to their length, that breadth
being especially remarkable a little above the lower end. At that end they
are very thin with both edges sharp. They are not distinguished by any
particularly strong curvature at the upper end, but they have there a “ca-
pitular 1111066166·ι longer and sharper on the left rib (fig. 47) than on the
right (fig. 48).

Of the 3Γᾶ pair ‘ff ribo only the lower portion of the left 16 found
(Pl. VI. fig. 49). This fragment 111 respect to form stands between the
2nd and 4th= pairs, as being somewhat narrower than the second pair,
