onlar sui-faces (“Hjorner“‚ cornera, Esons.) for the processus spinosi inferiores,
especially the hinder ones, are lat-ger and more prominent, as also wider
apart than in the effi, bnt less than in the 8¹²¹, and the transversal groove
between them is deeper than in the 6¹³¹, but shallower than in 1118 8111. Τ118
distance between the onter edges of the processus mammillares is greater
than in the 6¹¹¹, and about equal to that in the 8⁶¹. It accordingly appears
in all its characteristica to lie between the two above menfioned (61ιι and
8¹²¹) candal vertebrae. In the form of the lateral processes it agrees ho-
vewer more nearly with the 6¹²¹ than with the 8¹²¹. Its dimensione are:
Breadth of corpus in 110111 7“; height of (lto d:o 6-ξ-”; length of d=o‚ without
epiphyses‚ 3}⁴¹; height of processus spinosus 1}ss length of processus 118118-
versi 2·}“3 distance between outer edges of processus mammillares δὲ’.

The blade-bone· is precisely like that we have described ‚ but its
upper edge is more corroded and uneven , and the bone accordingly some-
what shorter. The point of attachement for the cartilaginous 8018801118
process is similar to that of the left bone, as also is the acromion.

The rib-fragment appears to have been part of 0118 of the hinder
ribs, but both the upper and lower extr-enities are wanting.

To the above made enumeration of some valuable contributione to a
more accurate knowledge of the Whalebone Whales we may add a worthy
treatise on the external characters and a part of the anatomy of Phytalns
antiquorum, by JAnEs Mum, Prosector to the Zoological Society of Lon-
don, in the proceedings of that Society 1865, pag. 206, and with the 111-

scription: “On the Anatomy of a Fin- Whale {Physalus antiquorum, Gray)
captured near Gravesendf‘
