6. Genus MEGAPTERA, J. Gau.

Fomn of tlze body tlziclc and compact, with lony pectoral sins, provided
with undulated maryins,· and a low dorsal fin, posited at the beyinniny of
the posterior third of the bodys lenyth. Processus coracoideus and acromion
rudimentary or wantiny, and processus coronoideus low but clearly recoqui-
zable. First pair of ribs sin-(yle and undivided at upper end. Number of ver-
tebrae 52—53. Lateral processes of atlas compressed‚ and situated above the
middle of tlze sides. None of tlte cervical vertebrae have annular lateral pro—
cesses, and sometimes a pair of them has more or less yrown toyether. Mem-
ber of ribs 14 pairs.

This is the most aberrant generic form to be found in the family of
the Balaenopteridae, and in its thick form of body and short vertebrae it seems
to betray an approach to the Balaenidae. The type of the genus is the Ba-
laena boops FABmcms or Balaena lonqimana Rnnowm from the North-Sea
and Nothern loy Ocean. We have moreover Meyaptera Lalandii (FISCHER)
from the seas around the Cape of Good Hope‚ and Meyapt. Osphyia E. D.
COPE ¹), from the sea to the East of the United States, and Gan* enume-
rates besides four uncertain speclea, namely M. Novae Zelandiae Gau,
from New Zealand, M? Burmeisteri Gau, from the Ocean at Buenos AyreS,

M. Americana GRAY, from the Bermuda Isle8‚ and M. Kuzz'ra GRAY, from
the Japannese WaterS.

2. Family Balaenidae, J. GRAY.

No dorsal fin,- under suvj'ace of body without yrooves5 echiskers lony,
fine and little if at all bont, the yreater portion at least of tlte cervical verte-
brae united dcc.

1. Genus BALAENA, messz.

of the cranial snout but little broader than the upper jawbones. The anterior
ribs with the lower end somewltat thiu and· compressed‚ and tlte number of

ribs 13 pairs. The whiskers with a sinyle row of fine bristles on the border.
We have as yet certain knowledge of only one species of this genua,
