In our work “vaersigt af Skandinaviens Hvaldjur“, printed in Upp-
sala Universitets firsskrift for 1861 and 1862, we have given an account
of such bones os this whale as have been discovered, but we consider that
we ought to repeat that list before passing to a description of those bones.
The bones found are:

The two lower jaw-bones.

4 cervical vertebrae: 1⁸¹⁵, 3rd‚ 4ῒ·11 and ssffi.
7 dorsal vertebrae: 1⁸¹⁵, 3rd, δῶ, Θῶ, 7th, probably the 13th and one

and 1 th,

14 candall vertebrae: probably lat, 21¹³, 4¹²1, θῶ, 9fl1, llffi—17ffi. 19³¹

4 metacarpal bones.
4 finger-bones.
One of the cornua anteriora of the os hyoideum.

the llth to the 14n= both inclusive, and on the right side the 3³¹
and 15ῒ11 ribs are missing.

ἸῚιε loaer jaw- -bones (Pl L figg.1--·4) furnishes one of the most im·
