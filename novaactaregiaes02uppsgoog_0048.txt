broad. The flagellum appendiculue of ste appar antem has 3 3811118,
with the 1·· joint longer than the other two put together, aad the po'mt al-
ways turned upward. The lower antennae are in both sexes, but especially

in the male, considerably longer than the upper. The claw of the back ’

truncal feet is long and but slightly curved. We have found the body’s

’ length 14 minim.

It is met with on our western coasts form Bohuslltn to Finmarken,
an in one or two places, as for example Haugesund and Molde in Nor-way

we have found it not uncommon, where the bottom is sandy, and at a depth
of 12 to 50 fathoms.

This species is known to me only by BOECK’S description. The
flagellum of the upper antennae has 8 joints‚ of which the first is as long
as all the rest together. The first joint of the flagellum appendiculare is
particularly long and provided with several spines on the lower side. The
exterior laminae of the maxillipeds have some few scattered coarse teeth
on the inner margin. The 3³⁶ candal segment has its lower and back an·
gles drawn out into a long hook or point bent upwards. &c It is taken
on the western coast of Norway.

This species is by the nature of the mouth’s appendages‚ by the
form of the hand belonging to the first pair of feet, and by the peculiarity
of its habits, so distinguished from every. other species of the same 3811118,
that it might very well be considered as the type of a distinct genus. The
mandibulae are remarkably small, have the egg—bearing end very small and
. both side teeth exceedingly small, and are without processus accessorius.
The- tuberculum molare is very large but thiu, brought up to 8 point and
destitute of bristles. The 1 *⁸ pair of maxillae are short and have both
branches ‚ especially the outer, very broad. The 1111181· branch has at its
termination 5 coarse ciliated bristles‚ and the onter has a great many spi-
nes. The palp has the usual form. The 2¹¹d pair of maxillae, which are
