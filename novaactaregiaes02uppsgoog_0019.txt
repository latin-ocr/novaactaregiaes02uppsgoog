that genus is according to WoovanD represented in the Antarctic Ocea
by some few species, but according to H. ez A. Amms ¹) by only one, the
Ceio australis Bnuo. The genus of Buce-inum ‚ including about 20 typicsl
species, also belongs only to the smtic and antarctic sess. The same is
the csse with the genus Raphon, containing about 14 speeies, the chief
part of which are from the Northern Seas (WOODWARD).

The Bryozoa often present examples of more widely spread geo·
graphical distribution than other animals of the lower section, aud of these
the same speeies have been occasionally met with in both the arctio and
antarctic seas. Thus for example the Retepora cellulosa. which is not un·
common in our arctio region, has by ROSS been found at a depth of 1620
feet in the South Polar-Sea ²), Lepralia Malam· BUSK, at Cape Horu, in
the Mediterranean and in northern Europe, and Flustra foliacea ESPER in
the Southern Ocean and in Northern Europe ⁸).

The difference between the Crustacea, which strictly belong to the
Arctic ἅτ. Antarctic Zones, is not so great as that between them and those
which are found in the warmer sess, but we know as yet of only 2 species
common to both, both of the lowest group, and only s few peculial-s genera
common to both Zones. Our knowledge af the Crustacea of the Antarctic Re-
gions is however as yet so imperfect as not at present to justify the utte-
ring of s. decided opinion on the relation, that may exist between the ant-
arctic ἃ the arctio Zones in this matter. The following genera are common
to both zones. order Podophthalmia: Lithodos LATB., Munida LEACH,

⁴) Mr ΤΗ. Fssms bas kindly presented to our University's Zoologiesl Museum
some specimens of a Schizopod that appears to constitute a link uniting the Euphmm‘a
Dnu with the Izymopoda M. Eumene, found by him aster a stol-m thrown upon
the shore of Wamgerfiord in the norwegiam Finnmarken. The last pair but one of
the truneal feet bas only the outer brauch or pslp‚ very small, and an almost im·
perceptible rudimeut of the inner branch or stem. We shall cau it Euphausia qlaoe‘alis
