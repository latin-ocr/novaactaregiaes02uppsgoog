with respect to the first named genus, the greater plenteousness aud larg-er

scas and more especially the northern. The genus Atylus according to
SPERCE BATE ¹) numbers 16 species. Of these 4 are from Greenland, Sweden
and Norway, 3 from England, 2 from Southern Europe, lfrom N. America,
1 from Valparaiso, 3 from Tierra del Fuego, 1 from the Cape of Good Hope
and one from New Holland. It belongs then more especially to the cold
ἆ temperate waters, but is howev er· in a very considerable⁸ degree of a

Of the 4 above-named distinguishing genera, Lithoder comprises 10
species, of which 6 are from the northern seas - North-Sea, N. Atlantic
and Icy Ocean and 'from the 'NE-coast of Asia — ‘1 from the eastern coast
of America, Lithodes australis BELL ⁸), aud 3 from Tierra dcl Fuego and the

that we as yet have no ‘certain characteristics, by which these two genera
can be distinguished, and it is probable that KROYEB would not have set
up Avwnyx as an separate genus, had he been aware that also the 2zd
