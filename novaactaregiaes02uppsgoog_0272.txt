12 W. ' Lam-:Boeo ‚

the upper eud cloven or biceps and the lower larqely emaryinated. Number
of vertebrae probably about 60 , all the cervical vertebrae separate. The atlas
has the lateral processe-s· above the middle aud of a conical form. Only the
epistrophaeus has annular side-processe& Number of ribs about 14 pairs.

Of this genus there is as yet but one species with which we are acquain-
ted‚ viz. the great Ostende· or Giant-Whale Flowerius qiyas (Escfflucm),
Sibbaldius borealis GRAY. By GRAY it has been ranged in 'the genus Sib-
baldius‚ but it differs so much both in exterior and interior characteristica
from the Sibbaldius laticeps GRAY and Sibbaldius Schleyelii nowen, that it
ought in our opinion to be considered as the type of a separate genus. Its
dorsal fin differs both in situation and form, and the lateral processes of
its cervical vertebrae are different, &a

4. Genus SIBBALDIUS, J. GRAY.

Form of body slender and elonyated‚ with small pectoral fine, and
dorsal fin os middle dimensione, and situated just behind the commencement
of the posterior third of the body's lenyth. Processu-³ coracoideus and acromion
stronyly developed‚ processus coronoideus hiyh. F iret pair of ribs with upper
end cloven or biceps and the lower end not hollowed out. Number of verte-
brae 55-58, Lateral proce-esee of atlas compressed, and situated in about
the middle os the sides. The old individuale have the lateral proces-ees on tlte
epistroplzaeus and nearest adjacent vertebrae annular. Number of riba 13—
14 pairs. <

According to FLOWER and GRAY we know with certainty two species
of this genus, and tere is a third which according to Gan may perhaps
be considered as belonging to it. The first, S. laticeps Gan, is from the
North-sea and North Icy ocean, the second, S. Schleyelii FLOWER is from
the scas about Java3 and the gra, S. antarcticus BURMEISTER, of which we
know only the bladebone, and which therefore cannot with certainty be
ranged in this genus, is from the seas about the south-eastern coast of
South Amerina, in the neighbourhood of Buenos-Ayres.

5. Genus ESCHRICHTIUS, J. Gau,

including the species Ε. robustus (LILLJEBORQ) or Balaenoptera robusta ⁴
LILLJEBORG, of which more hereafter.
