Only one species is known, Ο. antipodamem Gau, from the seas

, of N ew Zealand. In the court of the Museum of comparative Anatomy at

the Jardin des Plantes at Paris is preserved a complete aud articulated
skeleton, unquestionably belonging to the known species of this genus, and
this is doubtless the same whose existence was reported to Gau by MILNE-
EDWARDS. By the side of the skeleton is a smaller model in Plaster of
Paris of the whole animal, which however seems to us somewhat too slender.
The individual, a female, from which the skeleton has been taken, was
found in Acarva Bay, New Zealand, according to an appended ticket, which
bare the erroneous name Balaena ausa-alis. The present osteological notice,
the first published, of that genus, is founded on observatione of this skeleton.

4. Genus HUNTERIUS‚ J. Gan.

Accordinq to the description yiven by F LOWER (loco citato) of the struc-
ture of the cranium, it seems to approach, that of the ye‘nm Eubal a en a,
aad it is therefore probable that the moutkopeniny ayrees in its curvature with
that of that yenus. Number of vertebrae about 56. Die cervical vertebrae
are not all united, the posterior ones are free. Number of ribo about 15 pairs,
and the first pair remarkable for having] the upper end cloven or biceps and
vae lover end deeply hollowed out. Several of the anterior ribs di er from
those of the other yenera in that the lower end is not chin and commas-sed,
but very thick, ancl his section is an oval, approachiny a circle. Dte bla-
debone llas both acromion and processus coracoideas distinct and fully developed.

Only one species of this genus is as yet known, H. Temminclcii
GnAv, from the seas of the Cape of Good Hope. A cranium of an older
specimen and an almost perfect skeleton of a younger are preserved, accor-
ding to FLOWER, in the great museum at Leyden, and have been described
by Schlegel under the name of Balaena mysticetus antarctica’). The corre-
sponding form of the ribs as also of the bladebone in the Swedenborgian
male, (the latter being provided with both acromion and coracoide process)
incline us to range that Whale to this genus. We consider it probable,

¹) The only ground that Gan has bad for assuming the existence of this
genua, is the form of the tympanal-bone.
