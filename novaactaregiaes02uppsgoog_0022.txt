10 W. menone,

class, we especially remark certain hill planta common to the mountain·
of Europe and those of the antarctic Zone, but not met whith in the inter·
mediate uacts. Of these Hoom enumerates Erigor-on alpinus, Cam festiva,
Phleum aquinum and Primum sabmianum, but it is probable that on closer
examination these will be found to be nearly related but different species.
A remarkable example of a species common to both the Arctic and Ant-
arctic regions and not met with elsewhere, is afforded by the beautiful
and easily distinguised mosa-species Umoa mdaoeantha , which is met with
in Greenland and Spitsbergen as well as in New-Zealand and the most
southerly portione of America. The only difference between the northern
and southern forms is that the latter seems more thriving and fructifies
richly, whereas the former is a more delicate plant and has never yet
been met with in a fructificating state. It is also curious that a so remar-
kably distinct form as the Nephroma arcticum ‚ which is so generally met
with in the northern alpine and subalpine regions, should nowhere else be
represented by any analogous or similar form excepting at Magellan's
strait, where the very similar and nearly related Nephroma antarcticum is
met with. Among phanerogamous plants the genus Empetrum presents the
same phoenomenon, being in the North principally represented by the E.
niyrum, whereas in antarctic America the Ε. rubrum is the prevailing
species, unless (as 1 have lately seen asserted) this latter be also found
in Northern America.”

We now proceed to describe the¹ remarkable Amphipod Lysianassa

mapellanica.

It differs in many important features very considerably from the other
species included in the subfamily Lysiam-esim ‚ and we are accordingly in-
duced to consider it as the type of a separate genus. The first basal joint
of the lower antennae is large and swelling, and uncovered at the side
of the head, and is. limited above by a projecting point of the shell of
the head, which gives the head, when seen in profil a peculiar appeaf
rance. The first pair of maxillae is furnished with a thin and long palp,
at the end of which are two or three coarse bristles or small prickles.
The 7 ‘¹¹ caudal segment or caudal appendage, which is deeply forked,
is not provided with any moveable spine at the extremity of the lobes.
At least one such spine is found in all other Lysianassina which have the
caudal appendage forked. On account of its extensive geographical distri-
