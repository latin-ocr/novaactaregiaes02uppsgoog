guishes them is, that the processus coronoideus is rudimentary, in the form
of a tubercle, widening a little at the outer side3 that they are very little
beut, and that they have the back end very high, higher than the rest of
the bone, with a remarkably large condylus. As well in this last circum-
stance as with respect to the coronoide process, they present an approx-
ximatiou to the genus Balaena. The large condylus indicates that the cra-
nium had large articular processes on the temporal-bones. Eveu their an-
terior termination is different from that of the other Balaenopteridae iu as
much as that ‘it is nearly as much twisted as in the Balaena, so that the
outer side almost is subiacent and horisontal, and the inner is for the most
part directed upward. They are in proportion to their length higher than
in any other Whalebone-Whale. Their upper part is, in front of the coro·
nolde process, compressed and thin, and stands about as high up as that
process. On their outer side they present a slight uniform curvature, and
there one remarks 7 oblong holes for vessels διο. The distance between
the condylus and the great opening for thealveolar vessels and nerves is
less, and thus the collum shorter than in the other Balaenopteridae, but not
so short as in the Balaena. The back part of these bones is moreover di-
stinguished by their lower or augular portion being as large as the condylar
portion, and these are but little separated, and display ou the back part a
single continuone articulat surface. The height or longitudinal dimension
of the condylus is considerably greater than the transversal. The dimen-
sions of the lower jaw-bones are ¹): Length 8¹. 2⁰3 height over condylus
l‘, 5‘'; height over coronoide process 11⁰3 heigth in the middle 103!st From
the length of the lower jaw-bones we may infer that this Whale's head was
about 8‘ long. The left lower jaw-bone is on the outer side much injured
by caries. Though these bones differ greatly in form from those of the
Balaena, being much shorter aud higher, yet they exhibit in the character
of the corono'ide process, as also in their hinder extremity and the strongly
twisted forepart a stronger affinity to that genus than to any of the Balae-
nopteroldes3 and more especially these bones prove that this Whale may
with reason be looked upon as the type of a separate genus.

The found cornu anterius (Pl. Ι. fig. 5) which is about 17¹¹ long
in a straight line, agrees with the ordinary form of that of the Balaenop-
teridae. It is slender and slightly curved, with the front side (o) concave
and the back (d) convert, and the interior end (a), which is slightly turned
