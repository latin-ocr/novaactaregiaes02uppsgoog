well as on the preceeding‚ (9¹1¹, loth, or llffi) and δῶ, 6¹³1 and ’ἴθι there
is above the posterior edge of the base of the lateral processes a hollow
(fossa) sharply defined in from, which is deeper in the 5³¹¹, θῶ and 7⁶¹.
At the ends the lateral processes are thickened‚ but are yet provided with
but an inconsiderable articulating hollow, which extends from the middle
of the extremity obliquely under its posterior angle. Dimensions of this
vertebra: Breadth of corpus 9-3-‘3 height of d:o 7”; length of d:o 7}‘';
height of the vertebra to the top of processus spinosus 1953 rectilinear distance
between posterior angles at the ends of lateral processes 2' 83¹3} length of la-
teral processes in anterior border 13'‘; breadth of their ends 5{·''3 length

edges of processus mammillares 6-1-'2

The vertebra, which we take to be the 114*ί lumbosacral vertebra (Pl.
ΠΙ. figg. 18,19 and 20) is distinguished from the dorsal vertebrae in ha·
ving its lateral processes longer, thiuner, and less inclined backward‚ and
without articulating surface for the ribs, and from the other lumbosacral
vertebrae by these processes being thicker at the ends than in them. As
for the rest in form it differs but little from the hindermost dorsal vertebrae,
but has the corpus a trifle higher, the foramen spinale of greater height
than breadth, and the distance between the external edges of the processus
mammillares less 1). It is by this characterized as a lumbar vertebra. Viewed
endways the corpus is rounded oval, with the transversal dimension largest,
and the upper border of the anterior end very slightly concave, bnt the
same edge on the posterior end straight. The corpus on the lower side
along the middle is very convex but presente no ridge. The lateral pro-
cesses are very thin, especially at the anterior border, but at the point
forwards they are thicker, especially the left. The processus spinosus dis-
plays about the same form as iu the last described dorsal vertebra, but has
not so broad a point when viewed from the side. The right processus
mammillaris stretches farther forward than the left Dimensions of this ver-
tebra: Breadth of corpus 9-;“; height of (lto 733 length of dxc 8'‘‚ di-
stance between extremities of lateral processes 2‘ 1033 length of lateral
processes 13⁰3 height of the vertebra to the end of processus spinosus 2033
length of processus spinosus about 13”; distance between external bol-ders
of processus mammillares 5-''.

The 2ῑι nd luntbosacral vertebra is similar to the first, but the iateral

¹) In the form of the end of the laterai processes it agrees very nearly with
the 1⁸¹ lumbosacral vertebra of the· Balaena mysticam-9.
