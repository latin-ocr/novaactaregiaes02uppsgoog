graphs of the animal, sold at the exhibition, seem to indicate a less marked
protuberanee at the nostrils, and a more pointed snout, and secondly it
should be remembered that R HEDDLE iu his “N otes ou the Nybster Whale“¹)
remarks, that he had the opportunity to observe on another individual ap·
parently of the same species (Physalus antiquorum Gray), that the place of
the nostrils was sometimes flat and at other times boldly projecting. (“Τ118
blowholes were at times flat and unprojecting, at other times boldly prom-f
beraut, the animal evidently having the power of raising or depressing these
organs“). This observation goes greatly to diminish the value of this pro-
tuberance as a characteristic, which moreover was probably something smaller
iu reality than it has been represented in the figure referred to. One cir·
cumstance which however requires notice is, that although it is about 55¹
long, the structure of the bones indicates that it is as yet far from full·
grown, whereas the skeleton of the Physalus antiquorum at Bergen, as
well as the skeleton, also of a male, preserved in the Zool. Riksmuseum at
Stockholm‚ which is about 58' long, (the length of the entire animal would
therefore be 60'—ss2') has all the characteristics of an old full-grown indivi-
dual. The larger size of the Bal. carolinae in proportion to its age is a
circumstance that receives additional weight from the statement of G. Ο. SABS,
that the fishermen relate, that the “Tuehval“ is larger than theother Finuers
met with iu that tract, as also from that of HEDDLE, who says (ibid.) that
the individua, in which he had remarked the power of raising or lowel-ing
· the nostrils, was “a very large Finner.“ As the newspapers inform us that
we soon expect from MALu a detailed description of the B. Carolinae, we
may hope before long to be in possession of fixed points whereon to found
a judgement as tho whether it be or be not a separate species.

”2. Genus BALAENOPTERA, Licsspssnn.

Form of the body less elonqated than in tlze preceediny yen us. Pectoral
fin qs moderate lenyht, and dorsal fin tolerably hiyh and situated at the be-
