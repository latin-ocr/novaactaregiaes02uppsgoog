All the cervical vertebrae have been free. The epiphyses are fixed.

As, in addition to the first pair of ribs, which has been lost, there
have been found 14 pairs in a more or less perfect state, this Whale must
have had at least 15 pairs of ribs, and therefore 15 dorsal vertebrae. As
the 14 pairs that have been found are consecutive, and the appearance of
the 14⁹1 of them seems to indicate that it was the last, we have reason
to suppose that it had not more than 15 pairs of ribs, and accordingly not
more than 15 dorsal vertebrae.

The lut dome vertebra (Pl. Π. figg. 10 and 11) is as usual charac-
terized by its thinner corpus and its lateral processes, which are compressed
and largely inclined forward. The upper part of the arcus is lost. Its corpus
is destitute of ridge on the lower side, and is in the midst of the epiphysis
hollowed out both in front and behind. Looked at from the ends it is of
a transversal oval form, with the upper edge almost straight. The foramen
spinale is triangular, and its breadth is without question greater than its
height. The processus obliqui anteriores are but slightly projecting, and
the posteriores scarcely perceptible. The ends of the processus transversi
are high, bent downwards, and strongly compressed. On the lower side
of the left lateral process is a little articulat surface, probably for the se-
cond or third ribs tuberculum. On the sides of the corpus, beueath the
base of the lateral processes, 81111 1188181 the posterior horder is 8 field,
separated by a tuberosity projecting in front, partly covered by a harder
osseous matter, and concave, which has probably been the point of fixation
for the capitulum of the 4¹³1 pair of ribs, which is provided with a very long
collum (Pl. VI. fig. 50). The epiphyses are firmly fixed to the bone.

The dor-sal vhrtebra which we consider 88 the 31‘1 (Pl. Π. figg. 12
and 13) has also its lateral processes inclined forwards, but its corpus is
much thicker than the preceeding, and the externa] extremity of the lateral
processes is of 8 different form, broad, not compressed, and provided on
the under side with a concave articulat surface. The corpus, viewed from
either end is of 8 rounded oval form, with its tranversal dimension greatest,
with upper edge concave, and with both the anterior and posterior surfaces
plane. On the under side it has 8 low longitudiual ridge, and is concave
on the sides between the edges without any traces of an articulating area.
