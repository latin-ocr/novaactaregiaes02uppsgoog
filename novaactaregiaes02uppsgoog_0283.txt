The dorsal vertebra, which we consider as the θῶ, loth or mh,
differs from the 7*ἑιι in that its corpus is longer and higher‚ its foramen
spinale smaller‚ its lateral processes longer and more inclined backwards,
its processus spinosus longer, and the distance between the external edges
of the processus mammillares less. Compared with that which we take to
be the 13th (Pl. III. figg. 16 and 17), it differs in having the lateral pro-
eesses shorter and broader and with larger and deeper articular cavities at
the point, the processus spinosus shorter‚ the foramen spinale broader‚ and
the distance between the outer edges of the processus mammillares greater.
These differences are then of the same kind as those that distinguish the
‘3²1¹ from it, and are conformable with the continuous change in the verte-
brae throughout the whole dorsal region.

The dorsa! vertebra which we take to be the 13¹²¹1 (Pl. HL figg. 16
and 17) is distinguished from those already described by the length of the
lateral processes and processus spinosus, as also by the formers more slen-
der form and inconsiderable articular-cavity at the end (fig. 17 a). The
foramen spinale. is also smaller than in the foregoing and its height and
breadth about equal‚ and its form triangular, and the distance between the
outer edges of the processus mammillares less. Viewed endways‚ the corpus
is more rounded than in the preeeeding. but the width is nevertheless con-
siderably greater than the height, and the upper edge is slightly concave.
On the lower side along the middle it is much convex, but without ridge‚
and the sides between the edges are concave. The processus obliqui ante-
riores and mammillares are long, and project from the anterior* edge of the
arcus. The processus spinosus, which is much inclined backward‚ and
truncated at the point, has the anterior sharp border, viewed from the side,
somewhat concave, its extremity being broader. The lateral processes are
also much inclined backward‚ and have both the anterior and posterior edges,
with the exception of the latters base, sharp, but a little within the middle
of the former is a projecting rough protuberance. On this vertebra, as
