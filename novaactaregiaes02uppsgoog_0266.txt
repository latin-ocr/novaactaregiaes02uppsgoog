6 W. mennonc‚

this intention into effect, his indefatigable scientific activity was for ever
interrupted by his untimely death, to the great loss both of his science and
his friends, It is to be regretted that the work he had planned bas not,
since Prof. Escnmcms’ death , been completed by his worthy colleague in
the treatise on the Northern Whale.

Dr. W. Η. FLowER’s treatise on the whale-skeletons in the Dutch
and Belgic Museums, while evidencing the comparative anatomists experienced
eye and accurate perception of characteristic distinctions, has the merit of ma-
king us better acquainted with the interesting whale·skeletons preserved in
the two countries above named ‚ which offer types of new genera and new
species. It contains also some valuable remarks on the importance of the osteo·
logical characteristics, with respect both to individnal variations and those
which are the result of age.

Before proceeding to a description of the bones of the two whales
that form the subject of this essay, we will give a short account of the as
yet known genera belonging to the suborder of the Whalebone Whales, in
order to show in what relation the genera ‚ to which the specimens in que-
stion belong, stand to the other. In this we consider that we ought chiefly
to follow the arrangement adopted by Prof. GRAY in the above mentioned
work, with the exclusion of a few genera, which seem to us to rest partly
on very slender partly on insufficient characteristics.
