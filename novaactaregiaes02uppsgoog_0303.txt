so much greater than its length.- It is however at the upper edge thicker
than usual, but that is doubtlen a consequence of the aninals temler age,
especially as thet edge is irregular- and spongy, ac that the bone has evi-³
dently had a great cartilaginous continuation. Boffi the anterior and posterior

borders are concavo. On the onter side it is somewhat coneave with ra·- ’

dial, broken furrows. From the acromion thc spina scapulae extends so
far upwards, that it is discernible above the middle of the bone. The ca-

middle, with an acute angle in front and ronnded off behind, with a scar-
cely perceptible obtuse angle there. Its enter border is somewhat more
convex than the inner. Dimensious: Breadth at upper part 1⁴ 3-}“; length

ADDITION.

Since the above was written three bones of the imperfect whale-
skeleton last described, of the Hunterius Svedenboryii, have been recof
vered by Professor F. SUNDEWALL, of this University‚ and presented to
the University's Zoologieal Museum. These bones are: one candal vertebra,
right bladebone and part of a rib. As they are perfectly similar to those above
described, they do not contribute any addition to our knowledge of this
Whale , but they afford some confirmation of the views we have taken. -

The vertebra has evidently occupied a place between the 3td and 4th
of those above described, and is accordingly, according the probable cal-
culation there made, the 7th candal vertebra, which was there said to be
missing. Its lateral processes are less than those of the δῶ, bnt longer
and slenderer than those of the ΒΦ. The processus spinosus and processus
mammillares agree entirely with those of the last-mentioned, and the foramen
spinale is lower than in the Gth, but a little larg-er than in the 8th. The arti·
