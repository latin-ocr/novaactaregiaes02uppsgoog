That which we look upon as the next or 40¹ cervical vertebra, since
with respect to the form of the arcus and corpus, the position of the pro·
cessus obliqui and direction of the lateral processes, it exactly fits into the
preceeding or 3r‘l, is of 8 somewhat slenderer structure. The arcus is equally
large and 01 the same form, and the occasion is accordingly the same
with respect to the foramen spinale. Both the upper and lower branches
of the lateral processes (diapophyses and parapophyses) are parallel with
those of the foregoing‚ but both, and especially the lower, are slenderer
than they, and not quite so much directed back. Here also the upper branch
shows signe of a division at the extremity, but the lower process is there
much longer. It does not however show any signs of having been united
to the npturned point of the lower branch, but the interval between them
has no doubt been filled up with cartilage. The lower branch 1188 at the
back of its base a somewhat stronger projecting border. The corpus has
also here on the under side a blunt ridge, is concave behind and convex
in front, but is thinner, and its length 2'‘. It is destitute of the notch which
appeared on the hinder side and middle part of the upper edge of the
preceeding vertebra.

That, which we look upon 88 the ssffi cervical vertebra (Pl. Π. fig. 9),
shows a considerable agreement with the corresponding vertebra of the Ba-
laenoptera rostrata, except that the corpus is less broad, and the foramen
spinale rather larger and higher‚ though not so high as in the foregoing.
The corpus is without ridge on the under side, and the upper branch of

ι the lateral processes is much shorter and smaller than the lower, and both,

though but little, directed forward. The corpus is concave in the middle
both before and behind. The processus spinosus is higher than on the pre·
ceeding vertebra. The somewhat widening extremity of the lover branch
of the lateral processes bears evident tokens of the adhesion of cartilage,
with which the interval between the ends of the two branches has evidently
been filled. At the base of the hinder side of the lower branches is· an
edge extending abruptly out backward , or 8 depressed process. Dimensions
