ding” (scymnus borealis (Scoresby) Nilsson, on the banks by Beeren Is-
laud. The discovery of so highly developed an animal common to both the
Arctic and Antarctic Oceans‚ was something so uncommon that it caused
us to doubt the acuracy of Mum: EDWARDS' statement as regards the lo-
cality, Cape Horu, and to suspect that ‘the specimen described by that
author might perhaps bave been obtained in the French Scientific Expedition
to Spitzbergen, under P. GAIMARD 1838—1840. In order fully to ascer-
tain this we have in a letter to Prof. H. MILRE EDWARDS communicated the
bct that the Lysianassa mayellanica has been fiouud in the neighbourhood
eff Spitsbergen‚ and we appended a drawing of the same to compare with
the specimen in the Paris Muscam, and asked whether the alleged locality,
Cape Hom, were perfectly reliable. Mr. MILNE EDWARDS replied through his
Son ΜΓ. ALPuonss mes Enwnns that om· drawing was on comparison
found to cor-respond exactly wit-h the specimen referred to, (''ce me parait
etr-e bien la meme espece et je n'ai pu y trouver aucune difference appre-
ciable’ ⁹) moreover that it was certainly true, that that specimen had been
brought by D 'ORmGNY from the Strait of Magellan, and is entered m his spe-
cial catalogue of his natural-historical collectione from that region.

This animal is then widely distributed both in the Arctic and Ant-
arctic Oceans, and as it has only been met with in the stomachs of fishes
it seems probable that it is only to be found at a considerable depth. Its
tolerably large size and rapid motion render it difficult to catch with the
so-called dredge (’'bottenskrapa'’ Swed.)‚ and it has not, as we have been
kindly informed by Professor S. Lovssm been met with in the Swedish
scientific expeditions to Spitzbergen.

Its being found in both the Polar sess, and not in the intermediate
watffls, -- which however is not a unique phoenomenon ·-- is without doubt
a matter of deep scientific interest. It shows either that the same species
my have several centres of origination and geographical distribution, or
else that there have been periods in the developement of the earth, when
certain species of animals ἀ vegetables were, in consequence of uniform
temperatum aud similar climatical relations, spread over the whole earth,
which, on a subsequent variation of these circumstances. have retired to
tracta and regions where the original and to them appropriate climate ἀ
temperature continued to prevail. It is thus that the appearance of the La-
qopm alpina Nasson on the fells of Lappland‚ on tbe Alps ἀ on the Py-
renea, but not in the interjacent lowlands has been explained. There has
