of the ribs, which, as far as we are aware, agrees only with that of the
genus Humor-im GRAY, we consider that the Whale to which these bones
have belonged ought to be classed under that genus. We have unfortu-
nately not been able to perfect by personal examination our knowledge os
the skeleton of the only known species of this genus, Hunterius Tem·
mineth-ii, preserved in the great museum at Leyden, and consequently we know
the form of its bones only from the description ‚given by Dr Ftowssn in
the above-mentioned treatise, and some rapidly made sketches, which Dr
FLOWER has had the kindness to communicate. Dr FLOWER has indeed
only described the first and second pairs of ribs, both of which are missing
from among the Swedenborgian Whale’s bones, but the 31⁶, 4th and ὅθ)
are among those found, and the first of these, as is well known, differs
from the 2nd pair only in being somewhat uarrower and longer, and both
it and the -two following pairs show, allowing for this normal difference, a
close agreement with FLOWER'S description of the second pair, “very thick
and broad at the lower end.“ We know of no other genus in the whole
group of Whalebone Whales whose foremost ribs present so thick a form
at the lower end. The bladebone of the Swedenborgian Whale differs so
widely in the form and position of the acromion from that of the Hmetem‘m
Temminckii, that it is immediately evident that they belong to different spe-
eies. Moreover the former is distinguished by its unusual thickness, which
however may perhaps be ascribed to the circumstance of its having be·
longed to a very young individual.

We have in the above mentioned treatise on the Scandinavian Whales
given an account of the circumstances under which the bones of the Swe·
denborgian Whale were found, and shall therefore only recite here, that
they were in November 1705 dug up at wanga in West Gothland, 1⁴2
Sweedish miles (about 80 English miles) from the coast, and 330 feet above
the level of the sea, and that, little more than a century after, the late
Major L. GYLLENHAL, when digging a spring at the same spot, on the
estate Hoberg, chanced “at a deep cutting in of a brook“ ¹) to meet with a
vertebra of the same skeleton, fitting exactly to the otherS, and presented
it to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm 1823. This latter dis-
covery is a most useful guide in identifyi‘ng the spot where the original
discovery took place, and where a renewal of the diggings might lead to
results of the highest interest both to zoological and geological science.

¹) According to a kind communication in a letter from Lector N. E. Forssell at
Skara the name of the brook is Fjolbrobttcken.
