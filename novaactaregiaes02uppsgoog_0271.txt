Of this genus only one species is with certainty known, viz. Balaa-
aopt. rostrata (O. FABmclus) J. GRAY, which offers two varieties: Pteroba-
lama minor, variet. yroenlandica et hamensis, D. F. ESCHRJGHT, the one ob-
tained from the N orth-Eastern coast of N. America, the other from the we-
stern and northern coasts of Europe. J. GRAY ¹) ,from some fragments of
the skeleton has with some uncertainty adopted a 2¹²<l species, under the
name of Balaenopt. Swinlroei. It is from the sea iu the neighbourhood of
Formosa, but our knowledge of it is as yet so imperfect that it is no possible
to decide with certainty whether it ought really to be classed under this
genus. Professor H. C. L. BARKow ²) has described a smaller skeleton of
a young Whalebone Whale, preserved in the University-museum at Breslau,
which, though in other respects appearing to correspoud with the Balaenop-
tera rostrata ‚ differs remarkably from that species iu the structure of
the anterior extr-emities, on which a thumb with one phalanx are said to be
plainly visible3 but BARKOW has himself declared, that it is by no means
certain, that the extremities thus described belong to this skeleton‚ and
FLowER and Gau on this account look upon this species as very dubious.
According to Escnmcm ⁸) it is probable that a species belonging to this
genus is to be found at Kamtschatka aud the Aleootskia Isles, there some-
times kalled Techikaylueh, according to CnAmSSO, but it is far from likely,
that this should be, as Escnmcm, in consequence of the similitude between
that name and Tikagulik, the Greenlaudic name of the Bal. rostrata, sup-
poses, identical with that species. Another species may probably occur in
the northern part of the Pacific.
