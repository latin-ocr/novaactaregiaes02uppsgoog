proaeh to or recede from one anoffier like jaws, to which they have
some resemblance. The externa] build is conposed partly of thmner chi-
tinous laminae and partly of more solid chitinous ribs which form the solid
support of the former. The upper lip is somewhat distended and convex
and has near its apex a sharp indentation, from which that apex bends
itself inwards almost like a bird of prey’s beak. The middle portion of
the inner or palate side has two bristley-ribs united both in front and back
aud diverging in the middle, separated at the back by a notch from the
curved apex of the beak. The side-picces of the under lip are more solid
but thiu and flattened though uneven. (Fig. 5. b, b from the exterior, fig. 5·
from the interior). At the projecting, free, indented end (a) they are yellow-
ish, and their inner edge from the point to the base is armed with a thick
row of short bristles, so that they are evidently employed in dividing the
animal's food and conveying it to the swallow. The mandibulae are inserted
between the upper and lower lips and are thus for the greatest part of their
length separated from the maxillae.

The mandibulae (Fig. 3. d. ol and figg. 6 & 7 , the left) are about
5 ¹s² millim. long and peculiarly strongly formed. The masticating extre- -
mity (Fig. 6 α from the interior) which is bent inwards as we see it in
fig. 7. a, has a sharp, cutting and even or ‚toothless edge. This edge has
but a slight groove on each side, from which proceeds on the inside a curved
and somewhat raised line. At the middle of that line is a very small and
simple accessory process ('’processus accessorius”, BRUZELIUS⁸)), and from
that a raised edge thickly armed with at first somewhat coarser and longer
but afterwards shorter and finer bristles, which afterwards passes over to
the ’'tuberculnm molare” BRUZELIUS, (b) of which it forms the outer edge,
and when there is thickly set with short bristles. Between these outer
edges the tuberculum molare is hollowed out. On the fore side of the man-
dibula about halfway between the masticating end or edge and the insertion
of the palp is a strong almost hall-like notch (Fig. 6. c). The palp (d)
is large, and consists as usual of 3 joints of which the middle one is the
largest and longest, and is broadest in the middle, and it, as well as the
3¹ joint, carry a number of sharp bristles. The palp reaches to about the
end of the last joint but one of the lover antennae's shaft. Fig. 7 shows
the left mandibula seen from the outer side. As the masticating extremity

process in the genus Anonyoe‚· we have however found it in the most species.
