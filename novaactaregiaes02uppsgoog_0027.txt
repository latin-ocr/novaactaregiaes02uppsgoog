The 11611661 feet ¹) of the first pair (fig. 13) are short, particularly strongly
built and subcheliform. Their length is about 15 millim. The 2¹¹⁶ joint ¹)

is the longest and the hand or 6ιιι 16 almost rectangular‚ rather smaller at
the lower end, with the fore edge somewhat bent and the back concave and
bearing about 9 61661616 01· bristles. Its lower end is obliquely hollowed
out, and in front of the notch is fastened a strong, sharp, crooked and
flexible claw. The 5²¹¹ joint which is triangular is shorter than the 6¹¹¹. Its
feet are without gill-sack and lamina to cover the eggs.

The truncal feet of the 2¹¹ ¹¹1¹ pair (fig. 14), which are also subcheli-
form, are finer and longer 11166 1116 preceeding. Their length is about 30
16111116, and the breadth of their 2η ηᾶ joint is 2 161]1116.Τ116 31¹ joint is
scarcely half so long as the 2 ⁰⁶, which 16 almost of uniform breadth and
somewhat 116111 back 61 1116 lower end. The hand or 6 ¹¹ joint 16 61101161·
than the 5ιιι , 0111063 6611 01· almost uniform breadth‚ 61111 obliquely rounded
off at 1116 lower end. It has numerous long bristles , as have also the
joints already described. The claw 16 very small 61111 hardly perceptible.
The lamina for covering the eggs (b) and the gill-sack (c) are fastened 10
1116 1²³t joint or epimerum (a). The former 16 narrow and of uniform breadth‚
and bordered with long bristles3 1116 161161· simple, of considerable size,
and almost kidney-shaped. One observes on it only a few small irregular
wrinkles which have probably arisen after death.

The 3r‘1 and 4⁸¹¹ pairs of trunoal-feet (fig. 15, right foot of 3ΙΓᾱ pair)
are similar to each other and about 24 16111116. 1063. The 4ὼ Joint is longer
than the δῖ’), 161161661611 obliquely at the lower end, where, at the obtuse
projecting point, it 16 provided with long bristles. The δώ joint is about
the same length as the 4²¹¹, almost 6611011615γ broad, somewhat curved, and
at the back border provided with bristles. The claw is strong.

The truncal-feet of the 5t11--'7th pairs (fig. 16, 1116 6⁰¹ pair, right foot)
bear a close resemblance to eachother, and differ from all the preceeding

¹) We here adopt the denominatione proposed by T. THORELL, (Ofvers. af
Kongl. Vetensk. Akad:s Foth. 1864. pag. 9) according to which that part of the body
of the Crustacea‚ which is commonly called thorax, is denominated trunc (truncus),
and that part, which by other writers is called abdomen, is denominated tail (cauda).

²) The joint which we call the 2²⁶ has in general been considered as the 1⁸².
We consider that that part, to which the gill-sack and lamina for covering the 6336
616 attached, is the first, although it may be joined to the epimerum‚ or perhaps more
correctly speaking (according to spanos ΒΑΤΕ) constitutes what is called the epime-
rum. The gill has no doubt 66 insertion similar to that of the Podophthalmia.
