and undoubtedly it has its advantages, among which it is not a triffing
one, that a calculator is freed from all anxiety as to whether he have or
have not picked up all terms of any serious consequence: but on the other
‚hand it is extremely tiresome 61111 6 great defect in the method, that, if
one wishes to know the amount of perturbation at any assigned moment,
it is necessary to divide the time between that moment and the epoch of
the elements into short intervals, (usually, for the Asteroids, of 20 days),
and calculate the perturbations for each interval from the epoch of oscula-
tion till the given date3 aud, as each separate result is employed in ob·
taining the two next succeding results, any little error that may creep into
the calculation is dragged into all the following results, and that as pro-
bably in an exaggerated as in an attenuated - form. I therefore 011 the whole
much prefer to use a method, that gives the perturbations of the polar coor-
dinates directly in explicite functions of the time.

The inclination of Leda’s orbit is about equal to, and its excentri-
city less than those of Mercmy’s. This planet seems therefore to be one
to which the Laplacean formula is fully applicable‚ and Ι have accordingly
constructed the theory entirely in accordance with the scheme of the Meca-
nique Celeste. The symbols used have the same signification and are the
same as in the great work of Laplace‚ excepting that Ι have written the
indices under the letters to the right thus, A, , instead of 111 6 parenthesis
above thus ΑΨ, 66 16 110116 by Laplace, and Ι have introduced, as others ’
have done before me, the letter H,- with its usual signification, viz

The calculation, being merely provisional and intended for use only
for a very few years, that is, untill the orbit's elements are known with
sufficient certainty to justify the undertaking of a more elaborate theory ac-
cording to Hansen's method, has been carried only to quantities of the first
order. This, it is hoped, will be sufficient for the purpose aimed at, espe-
cially as there is no apppoximate commensurability between the mean-motion
of Leda and that of any of the disturbing planets, except Saturn‚.in which
case it is true that 13 times the mean-motion of the disturbing planet sur-
passes twice that of Leda by only 7¹.48¹·‚ thus producing a long inequality
with a period of about 2769 years, but a term of the 11²h order produced
by a planet so far distant from the disturbed body as Saturn is from Leda
can surely never be sensible.
