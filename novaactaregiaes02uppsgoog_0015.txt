The Εγτίαιιωω menania« is ‘one of the most remarkable Amphipods oa
accountofitsunusnalsize. lathi-respectindoedit surpasses all otha·
animala of the same suborder‚ and is sometimes cited as sn example of the
siae to which this suborder of Orustsccs can attain. These in fact seldom resch
the length of 1 inab, whereas the Lysianassa mayeuanioa is more than ⁸
inches long and is mol-cover of stent form and strongly built. We know af
a species of the family Hyperides, the cystosoma Neptuni Gitana-Mamm,
stom the ludim Oeean, the individuals of which are more tim 3 inehe-
long, but their form is meh slighter3 and a species of the family Ooeyoe-
pbalidoe, Rhabdsema matum ans, found between Amboina ἅ Van Dio-
mens land, which attains a length of 4 Ἰ, inchoa, but the form of tbc body
is almost threadlike. The Lysianassa mayellauica may therefore be justly
considered as the largest of all yet known Amphipoda.

Another circumstance renders it still more remarkable and that is
its extensive geographical distribution. It has been briefly described by
Η. Mam: EDWABDS ¹), who says, that it was found by D'ORmGNY in the
belly of a fish near Cape Horn, and was by that naturalist presented to the
Museum of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris. It was accordingly a matter
of considerable surprise when last autumn Mr ΤΗ. Μ. ΡΒΙΕΒ ’) . Junior Pro-
fessor of Botany , brought hither from the Norwegian Finmarken and pre-
sented to the Zoological Museum of this University three specimens os that
rare Amphipod, with certain testimony, that he had received them from a
shipper in Hammerfest‚ who had found them in the belly of an '’Haaskioe-
