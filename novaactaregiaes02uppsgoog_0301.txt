The 16¹¹· candal vemt-ra (Pl. X. figg. 102, 103) is somewhat
smaller than the last·,· is destitute of arcus, aud has the canalis spinalis
only on the sides bordered with projecting processes. As regards the fora·-
mina -for the branchos of the sorta, the one of them on the lower sides,
namely the right, is closed, and thus for the right canal there is in the
lower part only one opening, in the eavity on the under side of the cor·
pus. At⁴ the lower part of the lest side there is- on the contrary a very
small opening besides the larger one in the under cavity. Dimensions of
this vertebra. Breadth of corpus in frout ἕνῇ-ὼ ,height of (1· o dzo 5-st length

The last of the discovered vertebrae, or that which we take to bc
the 17th candal vertebra (Pl. X. figg. 104, 105) is almost circular. There
are only 2 lower openings to the canals for the sorta-brauches‚ situated
in the cavity of the under side. Of the canalis spinalis all that remains is
a very little hollow ‚ at the bottom of ‚which are three small foramina. Di-
mensions: Breadth of corpus in front 4÷“; height of d:o dzo 4-2-¹‘ length of

The brem-bom (Pl. 11. fig. 106) presente the simple form that it
usually has in the Balaenidae. It is oval, longer than it is broad, the fore-
part rounded‚ and with a little concavity in the right border near the point.
The hinder end is pointed , so that the side-borders there form an angle
somewhat less than a right angle. The side-parts are very eonvex in the
middle, also raffier thinner and bent obliquely upwards. It is hard and
solid, but the porous and thick edges indicate that it was entirely imbedded
in cartilage. It is particularly remarkable that that bone is so fully deve· ,
loped ‚ and shows such considerable hardness, although other parts of the
skeleton show that it belonged to a very young animal, and although the
sternum otherwise does not ordinarily at so young an age attain such thick-
ness and hardness. Its dimensions are: Length 6}st breadt 4}“; thickness
in the middle 13²!ss

The three perfect ribs (Pl. X. figg. 107--110 and Pl. XI. fig. 111),
which we may consider as belonging to the δή, 4¹³¹ and 5¹³¹ pairs, are
particularly characteristic for this Whale ‚ as has already been remarked. All
three belong to the right side. The first of them (fig. 107) is not quite
perfect at the lower end ‚ but it seems to be only a very small portion that
is lost. In proportion to its length it seems remarkably broad at the lower
end , which shows that it must be one of the anteriors. The upper end is
much compressed and bent inwards‚ with a rounded-off proj ecting angle at

the upper bot-der, without visible capitular process ‚ for the extremity itself
