The height is less than the transversal dimension. The lateral processes
are broadest about the middle and are at the base very slightly narrower.
‘ste area with which the lower ridge on the corpus terminates at its ante·-
rior extremity is plane. On the 1 1¹²¹ lumbosacral vertebra it its somewhat
convex. The articulat-suffaces for the processus spinosus inferior in the
hinder part are very small (fig. 31 a). Dimensions of this vertebras Breadth

The 2¹⁸1 candal vertebra (Pl. V. figg. 33, 34, 35) is similar to fflo
first, bnt has somewhat shorter lateral processes, articular surfaoes for tho
processus spinosus inferior also in front, and along the under side of the
corpus, from about half its length backvmrds, it has a groove, which in its
back part at the right articulat surface for the processus spinosus inferior
(figg. 33 and 34 a) presents the anomaly of having a tolerably long, com·-
pressed process. Its dimensione, with the exception of the lateral processes,
are the same as those of the last vertebra. Distance between extr-emities of
latera] processes 2' 1³23.

The 4¹²h candal vertebra (Pl. V. figg. 36, 37, 38) is much mutilated,
but it seems however that its lateral processes were less, and along the
middle oi the under side of the corpus it has a broad very shallow groove.
The hinder articulat surfaces for the processus spinosus inferior are very
large. The processus mammillares are thick, and the distance between their
external borders 5}ss the processus spinosus is broad and short, with the
point ronnded off, and a convex anterior edge.

The θῶ candal vertebra (Pl. V. figg. 39, 40, 41) is distinguished
from the 4ῒ·ιι by a shorter and higher corpus, ,with a broader groove on the
under side, an almost round foramen spinale, a smaller distance between
the processus mammillares, and shorter lateral processes. Dimensions of
this vertebra: Breadth of corpus in front Uin? height of d:o 9-{5'3 length of
<120 9-}‘'; distance between extremities of lateral processes 19''; height of ver-
tebra to the §top of processus spinosus 17''; distance between external borders

of d:o δ”.

The Ἰῒ11 and 8¹²³ candal vertebrae are lost. That which we take to
be the 9¹1² (Pl. V. fig. 42) is distinguished by shorter corpus and smaller
processes3 for the rising right branch of the aorta passes through a hole
(foramen) in the base of the right lateral process, and the corresponding
left branch passes along a tolerably deep furrow obliquely over the base
