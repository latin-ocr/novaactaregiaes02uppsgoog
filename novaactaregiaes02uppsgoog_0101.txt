The little planet, that forms the subject of the present memoir, was dis-
covered at the Imperial Observatory of Paris ou the evening of the 212‘
of January 1856 by Mons. Chacornac. Its diameter is statede be only
about 5 Sweedish miles ¹⁸¹ (= 33 English Miles or 53 Chilometres), and its
brightness, when in opposition, is somewhat inferior to that of a star of the
10²· magnitude. Immediately after the discovery the elements of its orbit
were approximately determined by the late M:r Pape of Altona. During
the earlier months of 1856 it was frequently observed at Berlin, as also
at Greenwich, Cambridge, Kremsmssnster, Gottingen, Liverpool and other
places, and from these observations a new set of elements was calculated
by Mr Lowy and published in the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of
Wien. (vol. XXIV) .

The opposition of 1857 passed without affording any addition to the
stock of observations3 for the planet having at that time a considerable
south declinationi, its smallness and low elevation rendered it a difficult ob·
ject even for the most powerful instuments. The number of good observa-
tions obtained during the first five months of 1856 was however very con-
siderable, and, by a careful discussion of these, H:r Alle was enabled to
deduce the elements hitherto used in calculating the ephemerides of the pla-
net, that have regularly appeared in the Nautical Almanac and Berliner
Jahrbuch, and which I have employed as the basis of the following theory.
H:r Alle's memoire on this subject was published by the Imperial Academy
of Wien 1858.

It would however be unreasonable to expect that a set of elements de-
duced from only four months' observation of a planet whose period amounts
