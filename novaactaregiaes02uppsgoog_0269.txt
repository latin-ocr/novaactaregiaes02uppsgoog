others, is ot so changeable a form, that much stress is not to be laid 011
this circumstance. In the general structure of the · skeleton the Β. Ca-
rolinae seems perfectly to agree with a young specimen of the Physaluae
antiquorum, the skeleton and stuffed skin of which are to be seen in tho
“jardin des Plantes“ at Paris, in the neighbourhood of the building for the
Museum of comparative Anatomy, although that skeleton is that of a some-
what smaller individual‚ (14 metres long), with only 62 vertebrae and 14
pairs of ribs, (the first pair being probably lost). The agreement between
them in the form of the lateral processes of the cervical vertebrae is com-
plete. As in the case of the Β. Gar-olinae, according to our own observa-
tion, the epistrophaeus has the lateral process on one side, viz. the right,
closed or annulat, and on the other open. In this as well as in the
form of the phalanges great similitude prevails between Β. carolinae and
the specimen of Halaenopt. musculus described by Gr. Ο. SARS in the above
mentioned treatise. In this latter specimen it is true that both lateral pro-
cesses of the epistrophaeus were still open, but the drawing pl. 3. fig. 5
shows, that that of the right side was more nearly to be closed than that 011
the left. We may therefore assume, that, in the developement of the lateral
processes of the epistrophaeus in tis species, it is normal that the right-
hand process first assumes the annular form. As regards the external form
of the body, the B. Cen-olinae, if we can rely upon the figure given by MALu
on the cover of the brochure referred to, presents some differences from
the usual type as set forth in the drawings of Solimon, Gr. 0. SARs and .
otherS, the snout being obtuser‚ and the portion where the nostrils are si-
tuated projecting pretty abruptly‚ or forming a kind of hump instead of a
hollovv, as it is usually represented. Between SARS’ and MALM'S specimens
there is however this correspondence, according to MALM'S photograph, that
there is a keel stretching along the upper side of the head. G. Ο. SARS ¹)
states that the fishermen on Norway‘s western coast characterize by the
appellation of “Tuehval“ a particular species of Finner, which is distinguished
from others by a large knotformed protuberance (Tne, hill, or Hus, house)
at the blowholes‚ and identifies it with S'rssiiu’s Tuehval, and says, that
according to the observations of the fishermen its in· and ex-spirations pro·
duce a peculiar dull sound‚ which seems to give some support to the assump-
tion of this ¹protuberance being a distinctive mark of the Bal. Car-olinae,-
but in the first place the aforesaid figure, given by MALM, has in all pro-
bability been drawn from the Whale when already stuffed, for the photo-
