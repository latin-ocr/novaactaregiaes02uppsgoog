Our knowledge of the Whalebone Whales, the largest of all mammals, 1188
hitherto been, and still is, very imperfect, notwithstanding the publication
in later times of several treatises on that subject, which possess great merit,
and materially contribute to dissipate the darkness, that has hitherto enve-
loped that portion of zoological science. Later observations have shown,
that the number of species comprised in that group is by 110 11188118 80 8111811
88 had been supposed, as also that those, which occur in the Southern or
Antarctic, 818 always different from those, which belong to the Northeru
Ocean. Since it was proved by the late Professor Escnmcnr that they
make periodical migrations, it has been evident, that several species, that
pass the milder 8888011 of the year 111 the North Polar 8888, emigrate to the
south in the colder season, and 818 occasionally met with in waters far
south of their natural zone, e. g. Physalus musculus COMPANYO, or Phys.
antiquorum GRAY in the Mediterranean3 but, as far as we 818 811818, they
never extend their wanderings to the equatorialÎ‡regions, nor do those which
belong to the Southem ocean ever enter the waters north of the equator. It
is however evident, that, in consequence of this, the geographical distribu-
tion of the species is very extensive. On this subJect much yet remains to
be investigated, and it is possible that closer examination and comparison
may show differences between speeies that have been hitherto considered as
identical.

As this distribution appears to be dependent 011 temperature, for some
species belong to the polar and others to the warmer 8888, it 18 evident that
under the different relations of temperature that prevailed in ancient ages,
the distribution must have been different from what it is at the present time.
