142) aud also according to what FLowssR has shown in the above cited
work, is without question a very young Physalus antiquorum (musculus),
or at least a species of the same genus. The description given hy G. Ο.
SARS, in his above mentioned paper‚ of the young Physedua antiquorum
taken at Lofoten in Norway, exhibits the closest agreement with the Bene-
denia in the form of the cervical vertebrae. The upper eud of the first rib
shows some differeuce in form, the capitular process being somewhat more
extended in the Benedenia. The lesser inflected and in front more tapering
form, displayed by the under jaw of the Benedenia‚ is evidently a result
of its imperfectly developed state. We are moreover of opinion that the
Cuvierius Sibbaldii Gray, or Physalzae latirostm Flower belongs to the genus
Physalus‚ as it corresponds with that genus in the large number of its ver·
tebrae and ribs‚ and offers no other differences of form, than that the snont
of the cranium, the nasal-hones, and lower jaw-bones are broader than those
of the Physalus antiquorum. According to this view Europe's Fauna has
only 3 species of the genus Physalus, viz. Phys. antiquorum Gray, Ph„
Deeyuidii Gray, and Ph. Sibbaldii Gray, of which however the second cannot
as yet he considered as fully established, its claim resting on the form of
the cervical vertebrae, which is subject to considerable modificatione during
the growth of the animal. The Balaenoptera carolinae shortly noticed by
A. MALM ¹) is a Physalus, which, though 55' long, is as yet but imperfectly
developed, and the skeleton of which in every particular, e. g. in the imper-
fect lateral processes of the cervical vertebrae, in the slender form of all
the bones (even the phalanges) and in the loose junctiou of the epiphyses
with their respective hones, clearly indicates a young individual. According
to the, it must he owned‚ somewhat imperfect examination we were en-
abled to make of it during its exhibition last summer in Stockholm , we
look upon it as a young Physalus antiquorum GRAY or Balamoptera mus-
culus L. COMPANYO. It has indeed one candal vertebra more (26) than is
usually the ease, accordingly 63 vertebrae in all, hut that number is given
by Escmucm and REINHARDT for a Balaenoptera musculus in their work on

preserved in the Anatomical Museum at copenhagen. With that specimen
the Bal. Carolinae also closely agrees in the form of the eternum. That
