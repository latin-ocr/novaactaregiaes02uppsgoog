upwards‚ somewhat depressed‚ with a round point and concave upper side.
and with the outer eud (b) almost round. This last mentioned end is not
larger than the inner ‚ which has on the under side a large oblong oval
tuberosity somewhat projecting at the back edge of. the bone, though not
visible on the side exhibited in the figure. The front border of the bone
is a little within the centre (e) sbarp, and the back border a little without
the centre has a projecting tuberosity‚ and the middle portion of the bone
is somewhat flattened.

The atlas (Pl. Ι. figg. 6 and 7) is very strong aud thick, and in
form corresponds most nearly with that of the Meyaptera‚ thoug it is
still thicker‚ and deviat-es remarkably from that type in having a di-
stinct hypapophysis (Rmzms) (a), pointing backwards‚ and accordingly
most- projecting at the back part of the bone. (Fig. 7 a). It also
differs iu that the foramen spinale is broad at the upper part and forms
au acute angle at the lower. It is somewhat oblique on account of the left
lateral process going higher up than the right, and the articulat surface for
the left condylus occipitalis is larger than for the right. The fossae condy·-
loideae‚ by carrying their upper and inner border a little inward‚ divide
the foramen spinale into an upper and lower division. The lateral proces-
ses are short, compressed, blunt, and knotty, and their height considera-
bly greater than their length. Their direction is somewhat oblique from
the lower part backward‚ aud they are situated above the middle of the
sides of the bone ¹) and directed obliquely upwards and outwards. Between
them and the upper edge of the fossae condyloideae‚ and nearer the latter,
is a foramen for the arteria vertebralis, which pierces iu an inward direc-
tiou through the base of the arcus (neurapophyses OWEN). This foramen
is shown in fig. 7 (b). The two fossae condylordeae or the concave arti-
eular surfaces for articulation with the condyli occipitales are separated at
. the lower extremity by a shallow furrow or sulcus, and extend with their
lower border beneath the edge of the lower arcus, so that this latter is in
its middle part hollowed out. The hypapophysis (a) is a blunt tubercle
pointing backwards‚ its point extending beyond the level of t'ne vertebra,
and it was doubtless received in a corresponding fossa on the lower side
and anterior border of the epistrophaeus. On the upper side of the upper
arcus is a rudimentary processus spinosus or neural spine. When the atlas

¹) In this respect this bone agrees with the correspondiug bone of the alleqap-
9aptera, but differs from that of the Sibbaldizoe, in which genus the lateral processes
also have the short and compressed form, but projeet from the middle of the sides.
