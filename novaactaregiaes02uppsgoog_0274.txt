viz. Balaena Mysticetue me‘J, from the N. Polar Seas. Besides this Gan
reckons three other species to this genus. Balaena biacayemis Gau, Bal.
maryinata Gau and? Bal. yibbosa Em, of which the first does not, and
the 2³11, which was found in the Western Australian seas, probably does
belong to this genus, bnt is known only by its whiskers‚ and the third
most probably does not really exist.

2. Genus EUBALAENA‚ J. Gau.

Mouchopeninq, viewed from the side, forminq an irreyular arch, the
back part rising) almost perpendicularly. First pair of ribs sinyle at repper-
and very broad at lower end. Bladebone without processus corae-aidau,
but with perfect acromion. Intevmaoeillary bone on the upper side of the cra·
nial snout much broader than the upper jau> bones. Number of ribs 15 pairs,
and the 2d and sequent anterior pairs samm-hat chin and compressed at their
lower end. Whiskers provided with, several rows of stiff edye-brzlstlee. ’

The type of this genus is the Balaena australis DEsuoanS, from
the seas of Southern Africa. There is moreover a species, Eubal. cisarcoiea
Ε. D. (3012131), from the ocean on the Eastern coast of the United states,
the structure of the· skeleton of wich is tolerably well known, and Gau’
adds another species, Eubal. Sieboldii Gan, from Japan‚ which however is
only known i a Japannese porcelain model.

3. Genus CAPEREA‚ J. GaA'Y.

Skeleton indicates a body similar in sorm to that os the Eub. au-
stralis, and the back part of mouthopeniny, viewed from tlte side, is almost
perpendiculam buch, what particularly distinyuiehee this yemis, is that the bla-
debone has only a rudimentary acromion and no coracoide process. Fir-st pair
of riba einyk at apper, and very broad and obliquely and sliylaly bollan-ed
out at lower end. The form of the cranium seems similar to that af tho
Eubalaena. All the cervical vertebrae are united toyether. Number ‘ff ver-
tebrae 55-56. Number of riba 15 pairs. Accordinq to Gray tlte tympana!-
bone hae the form of an irreyular oval rhomo, with the opening) very „nau

expresses the suspicion of the identity of this Wbale with the Bal. Rixayensis, bnt
his description seems to indicate considerable differences between them.
