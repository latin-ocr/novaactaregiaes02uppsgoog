deed received several different specific names, as the slight varieties of co·
lom· which it displays in widely separated localities. have by some ornitho-
logists been looked upon as indicating different species, though for our
own part we cannot but agree with Somnum ¹) in considering these as me-
rely local varieties. The variety that occurs in North ἃ South Ameriea has
been called Falco anatum BONAP„ and the Australiau form has been named
Falco melanoyenys GOULD.

The fishes found in the fresh waters of Patagonia consist, it ap-
pears, only of two or three speeies of the Salmonoid family, as is also the
case with the fresh water fish belonging to the most northern fauna.

Among the section of Mollusca are some instances which present the
phoenomenon of an extensive geographieal distribution, though their capabi-
lities for locomotion are very limited. Thus for example the Terebratula
caput serpentis is found from Spitzbergen to the Mediterranean and on the
eastern coast of North America, and the Rhynchonella Psittacea from Spitz-
bergen aud Greenland to England, Massaehussets and Siteha on the western
coast of N. America. Some species e. g. Saoeicava arctica, Venus pulla-stra
and Pet-ten pusio are found both on our northern coasts and at the Cape of
Good Hope though not in the intermediate tropieal regions. We may per·
haps be able to show with certainty any species distinetly belonging to
the Arctic Zone, which also occurs in the Antaretic, though one or two
peculiat- genera have been found that have their representatives in both
Zones. Bssolm ²) states that the species of Limacz‘na which belongs to the
south Polar Oeean can not be distinguished from the Limne-ina arctico be-
longing to the northern, but it has by Woonmnn ⁸) been classed as a se-
parate species with the name Limne-ina antarctico. 'Phat genus has no re-
presentatives in the intermediate seas. The same is the case with the ge-
nus of Punctum-ella, which embraces two species, os which the one belongs
to the arctio the other to the antarctic seas (in the neighbourhood of Tierra
del Fuego). Of the genus Clio we have in the northern Polar Seas the Clio
boreale, which is there found in such plenty as to constitute a considerable
portion of the Greenland Wm’s food. Passing over the intermediate oceans
